BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [0046] Figure 1 shows tumor volume (mm 2 ) as measured by calipers and estimated using the ellipsoidal formula for control, CAR19 with DNasel, CAR19, and DNasel experimental groups. Intravenous (IV) injections of human recombinant DNase I enzyme provided substantial efficacy boost for CD 19 CAR T cells. [0047] Figure 2 shows a survival graph for control, CAR19 with DNasel, CAR19, and DNasel experimental groups demonstrating survival benefit from a combination of CAR T cells and AAV DNase I gene transfer. [0048] Figures 3A-3C show flow cytometry analyses displaying the percentage of metastatic MC32a cells expressing PD-L1. Relative to control (Figure 3.4), PD-L1 expression was suppressed in metastatic MC32a cells from metastatic lesions from mice treated AAV- DNase I gene transfer (Figure 3B), as well as with combination of CAR T cells (Figure 3C). [0049] Figure 4 shows a graph of the percentage of Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA)- targeting CAR T cells in parenchyma of MC32a metastatic lesions. Data show an increased percentage of CAR T cells in metastatic lesions from mice treated with combination of CAR T cells and AAV DNase I gene transfer. [0050] Figures 5A-5B show a schematic representation of construction of an exemplary viral vector. Figure 5A shows a diagram of mDNasel mut P2A 4D5 IgG4 CAR comprising EF-la promoter and CD3ζ domains (4,237 bp). Figure 5B shows the full sequence map for a viral vector comprising mDNase IP2A IgG4 CAR (12,146 bp). [0051] Figure 6 shows a graph of DNase activity analyzed using a fluorescent probe in culture media of DNase I FLl-CAR-Ts, FLl-CAR-Ts, and untransduced control T cells. Activity was measured as pM/s (picometer per second). The data show gradual increase of deoxyribonuclease activity in culture media of DNasel FLl-CAR-Ts [0052] Figure 7 shows evaluation of cytotoxicity by Lactase Dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay for FL1-CAR-Ts, DNase I FL1-CAR-Ts and untransduced (mock) control T cells co- incubated with Raji-FLl cells. Reprogramming of T cells to simultaneously express CAR and DNase I enzyme provided superior cytotoxicity against target lymphoma cells. E:T ratio, effector to target cell ratio. [0053] Figure 8 shows tumor volume (mm 2 ) as measured by calipers and estimated using the ellipsoidal formula for placebo control (Group 1), FL1 CAR T cells (Group 2) and FL1 CAR T cells expressing hyperactive actin resistant mutant DNase I (SEQ ID NO: 5) (Group 3) experimental groups. Reprogramming of T cells to simultaneously express CAR and deoxyribonuclease enzyme provided superior efficacy for such dual reprogrammed T cells. [0054] Figure 9 shows the number of CAR-T cells in peripheral blood (determined by flow cytometry detection using biotinylated protein L and streptavidin conjugated with FITC). The data demonstrate that the combined use of DNase and CAR-T cell therapy significantly (for all p<0.05) increases the persistence of CAR-T cells in blood. [0055] Figure 10 demonstrates that the combined use of DNase and CAR-T cell therapy increases animal survival. [0056] Figure 11 shows percentage of animals with cytokine release syndrome (CRS) demonstrating that the use of DNase increases safety of CAR-T therapy and protects from CAR-T-related side effects.

In a separate embodiment, the nucleic acid of the invention comprises the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 30 or SEQ ID NO: 31. AAV vectors [0077] In some embodiments, the DNase enzyme disclosed herein may be encoded by a vector (e.g., a gene therapy vector). In some embodiments, the vector is a recombinant adeno- associated virus (rAAV) expression vector comprising (i) a capsid protein and (ii) a nucleic acid comprising a promoter operably linked to a nucleotide sequence encoding a deoxyribonuclease (DNase) enzyme. [0078] In some embodiments, the vector is a viral vector. Non-limiting examples of viral vectors include, e.g., adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors, adenoviral vectors, retroviral vectors (e.g., lentivirus vectors), and hepatotropic viral vectors (e.g., hepatitis B virus (HBV) vectors). [0079] In certain embodiments, the vector of the present invention is a parvovirus vector, such as an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector. The term “parvovirus” as used herein encompasses the family Parvoviridae, including autonomously-replicating parvoviruses and dependoviruses. The autonomous parvoviruses include members of the genera Parvovirus, Erythrovirus, Densovirus, Iteravirus, and Contravirus. Autonomous parvoviruses include, but are not limited to, minute virus of mouse, bovine parvovirus, canine parvovirus, chicken parvovirus, feline panleukopenia virus, feline parvovirus, goose parvovirus, H1 parvovirus, muscovy duck parvovirus, B 19 virus, and any other autonomous parvovirus now known or later discovered. Other autonomous parvoviruses are known to those skilled in the art. See, e.g., Bernard N. Fields et ah, Virology, Vol. 2, Chapter 69 (4th ed., Lippincott-Raven Publishers). [0080] In some embodiments, the parvovirus vector is a single-stranded parvovirus vector, such as an AAV vector. AAV (genus Dependovirus) normally infects humans (e.g., serotypes 1, 2, 3A, 3B, 4, 5, and 6) or primates (e.g., serotypes 1 and 4), or other warm-blooded animals (e.g., bovine, canine, equine, and ovine AAVs). Further information on parvoviruses and other members of the Parvoviridae is provided, e.g., in Kenneth I. Berns, “Parvoviridae: The Viruses and Their Replication,” Chapter 69 in Fields Virology (3d Ed. 1996). [0081] AAV vectors disclosed herein may be derived from any AAV serotype, including combinations of serotypes (e.g., “pseudotyped” AAV) or from various genomes (e.g., single- stranded or self-complementary). A “serotype” is traditionally defined on the basis of a lack of cross-reactivity between antibodies to one virus as compared to another virus. Such cross- reactivity differences are usually due to differences in capsid protein sequences/antigenic determinants (e.g., due to VP1, VP2, and/or VP3 sequence differences). Non-limiting examples of AAV serotypes which can be used to develop the AAV expression vectors of the invention include, e.g., AAV serotype 1 (AAV1), AAV2, AAV3 (including types 3 A and 3B), AAV4, AAV5, AAV6, AAV7, AAV8, AAV9, AAV10, AAV11, AAV 12, AAVrhlO (as disclosed, e.g., in U.S. Patent No. 9,790,472, Int. Pat. Appl. Pub. No. WO2017180857 and W02017/180861), AAV-LK03, AAV-LK06, AAV-LK12 (as disclosed, e.g., in Wang et ak, Mol. Ther., 2015, 23(12): 1877-1887), AAV-KPl(as disclosed, e.g., in Int. Pat. Appl. Pub. No. W02019191701A1), AAVhu37 (as disclosed, e.g., in Int. Pat. Appl. Pub. No. WO2017180857), AAVrh64Rl (as disclosed, e.g., in Int. Pat. Appl. Pub. No. WO2017180857), Anc80 (based on a predicted ancestor of serotypes AAV1, AAV2, AAV8 and AAV9; see Zinn et al., Cell Rep., 2015, 12(67): 1056-1068), avian AAV, bovine AAV, canine AAV, equine AAV, ovine AAV, and any chimeras thereof. See, e.g., Fields et al., Virology, volume 2, chapter 69 (4th ed., Lippincott-Raven Publishers). [0082] A number of putative new AAV serotypes and clades have been identified (see, e.g., Gao et al., (2004) J. Virology 78:6381-6388; Moris et al., (2004) Virology 33-:375-383). The genomic sequences of the various serotypes of AAV and the autonomous parvoviruses, as well as the sequences of the terminal repeats, Rep proteins, and capsid subunits are known in the art, by way of example, Srivistava et al., (1983) J. Virology 45:555; Chiorini et al., (1998) J. Virology 71:6823; Chiorini et al, (1999) J. Virology 73:1309; Bantel-Schaal et al., (1999) J. Virology 73:939; Xiao et al., (1999) J. Virology 73:3994; Muramatsu et al., (1996) Virology 221: 208; Shade et al., (1986) J. Virol. 58:921; Gao et al., (2002) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 99:11854; Moris et al., (2004) Virology 33-: 375-383; GenBank Accession number U89790; GenBank Accession number JO 1901 ; GenBank Accession number AF043303; GenBank Accession number AF085716; GenBank Accession number NC 006152; GenBank Accession number Y18065; GenBank Accession number NC 006260; GenBank Accession number NC_006261; International Patent Publication Nos. WO 00/28061, WO 99/61601, WO 98/11244; and U.S. Pat. No. 6,156,303, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein for teaching parvovirus and AAV nucleic acid and amino acid sequences. [0083] The genomic organization of all known AAV serotypes is very similar. The genome of AAV is a linear, single-stranded DNA molecule that is less than about 5,000 nucleotides (nt) in length. Inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) flank the unique coding nucleotide sequences for the non-structural replication (Rep) proteins and the structural (VP) proteins. The VP proteins (VPl, VP2 and VP3) form the capsid. The terminal 145 nucleotides are self-complementary and are organized so that an energetically stable intramolecular duplex forming a T-shaped hairpin may be formed. These hairpin structures function as an origin for viral DNA replication, serving as primers for the cellular DNA polymerase complex. Following wtAAV infection in mammalian cells the Rep genes (i.e. Rep78 and Rep52) are expressed from the P5 promoter and the P19 promoter, respectively and both Rep proteins have a function in the replication of the viral genome. [0084] In some embodiments, recombinant AAV (rAAV) vectors comprise one or more nucleotide sequences of interest that are flanked by at least one parvoviral or AAV inverted terminal repeat sequence (ITR). Such rAAV vectors can be replicated and packaged into viral particles when produced in a packaging cell that is expressing AAV rep and cap gene products (i.e., AAV Rep and Cap proteins). The terms “AAV Cap protein” or “AAV capsid protein”, as used herein, refer to a polypeptide having at least one functional activity of a native AAV Cap protein (e.g., VP1, VP2, VP3). Examples of functional activities of Cap proteins (e.g., VP1, VP2, VP3) include the ability to induce formation of a capsid, facilitate accumulation of single-stranded DNA, facilitate AAV DNA packaging into capsids (i.e., encapsidation), bind to cellular receptors, and facilitate entry of the virion into host cells. [0085] In some embodiments, the AAV vectors may comprise desired proteins or protein variants. A “variant” as used herein, refers to an amino acid sequence that is altered by one or more amino acids. The variant may have “conservative” changes, wherein a substituted amino acid has similar structural or chemical properties, e.g., replacement of leucine with isoleucine. More rarely, a variant may have “nonconservative” changes, e.g., replacement of a glycine with a tryptophan. Analogous minor variations may also include amino acid deletions or insertions, or both. [0086] AAV vectors are packaged into AAV viral capsids. The sequence of an AAV viral capsid protein defines numerous features of a particular AAV vector. For example, the capsid protein affects capsid structure and assembly, interactions with AAV nonstructural proteins such as Rep and AAP proteins, interactions with host body fluids and extracellular matrix, clearance of the virus from the blood, vascular permeability, antigenicity, reactivity to neutralizing antibodies, tissue/organ/cell type tropism, efficiency of cell attachment and internalization, intracellular trafficking routes, virion uncoating rates, among others. The sequence of a capsid protein (e.g., VP3) may be altered to enhance delivery to the liver. [0087] AAV constructs may comprise a sequence encoding one or more capsid proteins (VP1 and/or VP2, and/or VP3 capsid proteins, preferably just VP3 capsid protein) which package the polynucleotide sequence disclosed herein. The sequences coding for the capsid protein(s) for use in the context of the present invention may be taken from any of the known 42 serotypes, such as, e.g., AAV1, AAV2, AAV3, AAV4, AAV5, AAV6, AAV7, AAV8, AAV9, Anc80, or newly developed AAV-like particles obtained by, e.g., capsid shuffling techniques and/or use of AAV capsid libraries. For some non-limiting examples of capsid protein sequences, see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 9,790,472; 9,677,089; 7,282,199; Int. Pat. Appl. Publ. Nos. WO 2015/054653, WO2017/180857 (AAV8, AAV9, AAVrhlO, AAVhu37, AAVrh64Rl), W02017/180861 (AAVrhlO), WO2017/180854 (AAV8 mutants), and Wang et al., Mol. Ther., 2015, 23(12): 1877-1887 (AAV8, AAVrhlO, AAV3B, and AAV-LK03). When the sequences encoding the capsid proteins derive from a different AAV serotype as the ITRs, the AAV construct is known as a “hybrid” parvovirus genome (i.e., in which the AAV capsid and the AAV terminal repeat(s) are from different AAV) as described in Int. Pat. Appl. Publ. No. WO 00/28004 and Chao et al., (2000) Molecular Therapy 2:619. [0088] In some embodiments, the capsid protein(s) mediates efficient targeting of the AAV vector to the liver. In some embodiments, the capsid protein(s) mediate preferential targeting of the AAV vector to the liver. Some capsid proteins (e.g., VP3 of Anc80, AAV8 and AAV3B) are naturally liver-specific. The invention also encompasses the use of AAV capsid mutants which enhance liver targeting and/or liver specificity. Non-limiting examples of such point mutations to the AAV8 capsid sequence include, e.g., S279A, S671 A, K137R, and T252A, as well as AAV8 capsid mutations disclosed in Int. Pat. Appl. Pub. No. WO2017/180854 (e.g., AAV3G1, AAVT20 or AAVTR1, VP3 mutations in amino acids 263-267 [e.g., 263NGTSG267->SGTH or 263NGTSG267->SDTH ("NGTSG" is disclosed as SEQ ID NO: 54; "SGTH" is disclosed as SEQ ID NO: 55, and "SDTH" is disclosed as SEQ ID NO: 56)] and/or amino acids 457-459 [e.g., 457TAN459->SRP], and/or amino acids 455-459 [e.g., 455GGTAN459 ->DGSGL ("GGTAN" is disclosed as SEQ ID NO: 57 and "DGSGL" is disclosed as SEQ ID NO: 58) and/or amino acids 583-597). [0089] In some embodiments, the capsid protein(s) mediates efficient targeting of the AAV vector to the nervous system. In some embodiments, the capsid protein(s) mediate preferential targeting of the AAV vector both to the liver and to the nervous system. Some capsid proteins would naturally target both the liver and the nervous system. The invention also encompasses the use of AAV capsid mutants which enhance targeting to the liver and/or the nervous system. [0090] In some embodiments, the capsid protein comprises one or more mutations which improve efficiency and/or specificity of the delivery of the vector to the liver and/or nervous system as compared to the corresponding wild-type capsid protein. In one embodiment, the improved efficiency and/or specificity of the delivery of the vector to the liver results in a substantially increased expression of the enzyme in the liver as compared to other tissues and organs. In one embodiment, the improved efficiency and/or specificity of the delivery of the vector to the nervous system results in a substantially increased expression of the enzyme in the nervous system as compared to other tissues and organs.

No. WO2017/180854 (e.g., comprising VP3 mutations in amino acids 263-267 [e.g., 263NGTSG267->SGTH or 263NGTSG267->SDTH ("NGTSG" is disclosed as SEQ ID NO: 54; "SGTH" is disclosed as SEQ ID NO: 55, and "SDTH" is disclosed as SEQ ID NO: 56)] and/or amino acids 457-459 [e.g., 457TAN459->SRP], and/or amino acids 455-459 [e.g., 455GGTAN459 ->DGSGL] ("GGTAN" is disclosed as SEQ ID NO: 57 and "DGSGL" is disclosed as SEQ ID NO: 58) and/or amino acids 583-597).

In some embodiments, the promoter is specific for tumor originator tissue or metastasis target tissue. [0093] In some embodiments, any of the AAV vectors disclosed herein may comprise one or more enhancers located upstream or downstream of the promoter. In some embodiments, the one or more enhancers may be selected from the group consisting of an apolipoprotein E (ApoE) enhancer, an alpha fetoprotein enhancer, a TTR enhancer, an LSP enhancer, an α1- microglobulin/bikunin enhancer, an albumin gene enhancer (Ealb), a nPE2 enhancer, a Gal4 enhancer, a foxP2 enhancer, aMef2 enhancer, a CMV enhancer, and any combination thereof. In one embodiment, the enhancer is an apolipoprotein E (ApoE) enhancer. In some embodiments, the enhancer is a hepatic control region (HCR) enhancer. In some embodiments, the enhancer comprises a sequence having at least 80% or at least 85% or at least 90% or at least 95% sequence identity to SEQ ID NO: 17. In one embodiment, the enhancer comprises the sequence SEQ ID NO: 17. In one embodiment, the enhancer consists of the sequence SEQ ID NO: 17. [0094] In one embodiment of any of the vectors described above, the nucleic acid further comprises a polyadenylation signal operably linked to the nucleotide sequence encoding the DNase enzyme. [0095] In some embodiments, the nucleic acid further comprises a Kozak sequence. In one specific embodiment, the Kozak sequence comprises the sequence of 5'-GCCGCCACC-3' (SEQ ID NO: 33). In one embodiment, the nucleic acid comprises a nucleotide sequence which is at least 80% identical to SEQ ID NO: 30. In one embodiment, the nucleic acid comprises a nucleotide sequence which is at least 85% identical to SEQ ID NO: 30.

In one embodiment, the nucleic acid comprises a nucleotide sequence which is at least 95% identical to SEQ ID NO: 30.

[0096] In one embodiment of any of the vectors described above, the nucleic acid further comprises a post-transcriptional regulatory element.

In one embodiment, the WPRE does not encode a functional X protein.

In one embodiment, the post-transcriptional regulatory element comprises the sequence SEQ ID NO: 16. In one embodiment, the post-transcriptional regulatory element consists of the sequence SEQ ID NO: 16. [0097] The AAV vectors of the invention may also contain non-resolvable terminal repeats. The expression “non-resolvable terminal repeat”, as used herein, relates to terminal repeats which are not recognized by and resolved (i.e., “nicked”) by the AAV Rep proteins, such that resolution of the terminal repeat is substantially reduced (e.g., by at least about 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%. 90%, 95%, 98% or greater as compared with a resolvable terminal repeat) or eliminated. Such non-resolvable terminal repeats may be naturally-occurring terminal repeat sequences (including altered forms thereof) and, for example, can be derived from a parvovirus, including an AAV, or can be from another virus or, as a further alternative, can be partially or completely synthetic. The non-resolvable terminal repeat may be a non-AAV viral sequence that is not recognized by the AAV Rep proteins, or it can be an AAV terminal repeat that has been modified (e.g., by insertion, substitution and/or deletion) so that it is no longer recognized by the AAV Rep proteins. Further, a non-resolvable terminal repeat can be any terminal repeat that is non-resolvable under the conditions used to produce the virus vector. Further, an AAV terminal repeat can be modified so that resolution by the AAV Rep proteins is substantially reduced or eliminated. The non-resolvable terminal repeat can be any inverted repeat sequence that forms a hairpin structure and cannot be nicked by the AAV Rep proteins. [0098] The inverted terminal repeats (ITR) are typically present in at least two copies in the AAV vector, typically flanking the expression cassette containing the nucleotide sequence(s) encoding a DNase enzyme. The ITRs typically will be at the 5' and 3' ends of the nucleotide sequence(s) encoding a DNase enzyme but need not be contiguous thereto. The ITRs can be the same or different from each other. The term “terminal repeat” includes any viral terminal repeat and/or partially or completely synthetic sequences that form hairpin structures and function as an inverted terminal repeat, such as the “double-D sequence” as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,478,745 to Samulski et al. An “AAV terminal repeat” may be from any AAV, including but not limited to serotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, Anc80, or any other AAV now known or later discovered. The AAV terminal repeat need not have a wild-type sequence (e.g., a wild-type sequence may be altered by insertion, deletion, truncation or missense mutations), as long as the terminal repeat mediates the desired functions, e.g., replication, nicking, virus packaging, integration, and/or provirus rescue, and the like. The vector construct can comprise one or more (e.g., two) AAV terminal repeats, which may be the same or different. Further, the one or more AAV terminal repeats can be from the same AAV serotype as the AAV capsid, or can be different. In particular embodiments, the vector construct comprises an AAV1, AAV2, AAV3, AAV4, AAV5, AAV6, AAV7, AAV8, AAV9, AAV10, AAV11, AAV12, and/or Anc80 terminal repeat. [0099] Parvoviral ITR nucleotide sequences are typically palindromic sequences, comprising mostly complementary, symmetrically arranged sequences also referred to as “A,” “B,” and “C” regions. The ITR functions as an origin of replication, a site having a “cis” role in replication, i.e., being a recognition site for trans acting replication proteins such as e.g. Rep 78 (or Rep68) which recognize the palindrome and specific sequences internal to the palindrome. One exception to the symmetry of the ITR sequence is the “D” region of the ITR. It is unique (not having a complement within one ITR). Nicking of single-stranded DNA occurs at the junction between the A and D regions. It is the region where new DNA synthesis initiates. The D region normally sits to one side of the palindrome and provides directionality to the nucleic acid replication step. A parvovirus replicating in a mammalian cell typically has two ITR sequences. It is, however, possible to engineer an ITR so that binding sites are on both strands of the A regions and D regions are located symmetrically, one on each side of the palindrome. On a double-stranded circular DNA template (e.g., a plasmid), the Rep78- or Rep68-assisted nucleic acid replication then proceeds in both directions and a single ITR suffices for parvoviral replication of a circular vector. Thus, one ITR nucleotide sequence can be used in the context of the present invention. Two or another even number of regular ITRs can be used. [00100] Functional ITR sequences are necessary for the replication, rescue and packaging of AAV virions. The ITR sequences may be wild type sequences or may have at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or 100% sequence identity with wild type sequences. The ITR sequences may be altered by for example in insertion, mutation, deletion or substitution of nucleotides, as long as they remain functional. In this context, functionality refers to the ability to direct packaging of the genome into the capsid shell and then allow for expression in the host cell to be transduced or target cell. [00101] The AAV vector can comprise single stranded or double stranded (self- complementary) DNA. The single stranded nucleic acid molecule is either sense or antisense strand, as both polarities are equally capable of gene expression. The AAV vector may further comprise a marker or reporter gene, such as a gene for example encoding an antibiotic resistance gene, a fluorescent protein (e.g., GFP) or a gene encoding a chemically, enzymatically or otherwise detectable and/or selectable product (e.g., lacZ, aph, etc.) known in the art. [00102] AAV expression vectors may comprise a nucleic acid that may include a secretory signal sequence allowing secretion of the encoded DNase enzyme from the transduced cell. Non-limiting examples of such secretory signal sequences include, e.g., DNase I secretory signal sequence, IL2 secretory signal sequence, albumin secretory signal sequence, β- glucuronidase secretory signal sequence, alkaline protease secretory signal sequence, and fibronectin secretory signal sequence. [00103] In some embodiments, an AAV8-based or an Anc80-based vector is used as the expression vector. The AAV8 and Anc80 vectors are particularly suited for liver targeting and expression. For example, both AAV8 and Anc80 vectors can transfect liver cells with greater efficiency as compared to an AAV2 vector. Both AAV8 and Anc80 also induce lower amounts of neutralizing antibodies than some of the other AAV vectors. [00104] An AAV8 vector or an Anc80 vector comprising a nucleotide encoding a DNase enzyme can be administered intrahepatically (e.g., via direct organ injection) or systemically, e.g., by intravenous injection, with the AAV8 or Anc80 vector effective to transfect liver cells and mediate effective production of the encoded DNase enzyme and its secretion in the peri endothelial space and the space of Disse. In some embodiments, an Anc80 capsid protein (e.g., Anc80 VP1 capsid protein comprising the sequence SEQ ID NO: 3 or SEQ ID NO: 9, or an Anc80L65 VP1 capsid protein comprising the sequence of SEQ ID NO:34, or a variant Anc80L65 VP1 capsid protein comprising the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 35) is encoded by a nucleotide sequence in the expression vector. In some embodiments, an AAV8 capsid protein (e.g., AAV8 VP1 or AAV8 VP3) is encoded by a nucleotide sequence in the expression vector. Peripheral administration of the AAV vectors of the invention may include systemic injections, such as, e.g., intramuscular, intravenous, intraperitoneal, and intra-arterial injections. [00105] In some embodiments, an AAV3-based, or an AAV-LK03, or an AAV-KP1 vector is used as the expression vector. The AAV3, AAV-LK03 and AAV-KP1 vectors are particularly suited for liver targeting and expression. For example, AAV3, AAV-LK03 and AAV-KP1 vectors can transfect liver cells with greater efficiency as compared to an AAV2 vector. Both AAV-LK03 and AAV-KP1 also induce lower amounts of neutralizing antibodies than some of the other AAV vectors. [00106] The desired doses of the DNase enzyme encoding AAV vectors of the invention may be easily adapted by the skilled artisan, e.g., depending on the disease condition, the subject, the treatment schedule, etc. In some embodiments, from 10e5 to 101e4 recombinant viral particles are administered per dose, for example, from 10e6 to 10e11, from 10e7 to 10e11, or from 108 to 1014. In other embodiments, exemplary doses for achieving therapeutic effects may include titers of at least about 10e5, 10e6, 10e7, 10e8, 10e9, 10e10 or 10e11 recombinant viral particles or more. [00107] The exogenous targeting sequence(s) may replace or substitute part or all of a major capsid subunit (e.g., VP3). As a further alternative, more than one exogenous targeting sequence, e.g., two, three, four, five or more sequences, may be introduced into the virion capsid. In alternative embodiments, insertions and substitutions within the minor capsid subunits (e.g., VP1 and VP2) may be undertaken. For AAV capsids, insertions or substitutions in VP2 or VP3 may be undertaken. [00108] The native virion tropism may be reduced or abolished by insertion or substitution of the amino acid sequence. Alternatively, the insertion or substitution of the exogenous amino acid sequence may target the virion to a particular cell type(s). The exogenous targeting sequence may be any amino acid sequence encoding a protein or peptide that alters the tropism of the virion. In particular embodiments, the targeting peptide or protein may be naturally occurring or, alternately, completely or partially synthetic. Exemplary peptides and proteins include ligands and other peptides that bind to cell surface receptors present in liver cells include ligands capable of binding the Sr-B 1 receptor for apoliprotein E, galactose- and lactose- specific lectins, low density lipoprotein receptor ligands, asialoglycoprotein (galactose- terminal) ligands and the like. [00109] Alternatively, the exogenous targeting sequence may be an antibody or an antigen- recognizing moiety thereof. The term “antibody” as used herein refers to all types of immunoglobulins, including IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, and IgE. The antibodies may be monoclonal or polyclonal and may be of any species of origin, including (for example) mouse, rat, rabbit, horse, or human, or may be chimeric antibodies. Also encompassed by the term “antibody” are bispecific or “bridging” antibodies as known by those skilled in the art. Antibody fragments within the scope of the present invention include, for example, Fab, F(ab')2, and Fc fragments, and the corresponding fragments obtained from antibodies other than IgG. Such fragments may be produced by known techniques. The exogenous amino acid sequence inserted into the virion capsid may be one that facilitates purification or detection of the virion. For example, the exogenous amino acid sequence may include a poly-histidine sequence that is useful for purifying the virion over a nickel column, as is known to those skilled in the art or an antigenic peptide or protein that may be employed to purify the virion by standard immunopurification techniques. Alternatively, the amino acid sequence may encode a receptor ligand or any other peptide or protein that may be used to purify the modified virion by affinity purification or any other techniques known in the art (e.g., purification techniques based on differential size, density, charge, or isoelectric point, ion-exchange chromatography, or peptide chromatography) . [00110] Alternatively, the exogenous targeting sequence may be an antibody or an antigen- recognizing moiety thereof. The term “antibody” as used herein refers to all types of immunoglobulins, including IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, and IgE. The antibodies may be monoclonal or polyclonal and may be of any species of origin, including (for example) mouse, rat, rabbit, horse, or human, or may be chimeric antibodies. Also encompassed by the term “antibody” are bispecific or “bridging” antibodies as known by those skilled in the art. Antibody fragments within the scope of the present invention include, for example, Fab, F(ab')2, and Fc fragments, and the corresponding fragments obtained from antibodies other than IgG. Such fragments may be produced by known techniques. [00111] The exogenous amino acid sequence inserted into the virion capsid may be one that facilitates purification or detection of the virion. According to this aspect of the invention, it is not necessary that the exogenous amino acid sequence also alters the virion of the modified parvovirus. For example, the exogenous amino acid sequence may include a poly-histidine sequence that is useful for purifying the virion over a nickel column, as is known to those skilled in the art or an antigenic peptide or protein that may be employed to purify the virion by standard immunopurification techniques. Alternatively, the amino acid sequence may encode a receptor ligand or any other peptide or protein that may be used to purify the modified virion by affinity purification or any other techniques known in the art (e.g., purification techniques based on differential size, density, charge, or isoelectric point, ion-exchange chromatography, or peptide chromatography).

[00129] As used herein, "effective amount" includes a dose suitable for treating a mammal having a clinically defined disorder. [00130] An “analog,” “variant” or “derivative” is a compound substantially similar in structure and having the same biological activity, albeit in certain instances to a differing degree, to a naturally-occurring molecule. For example, a polypeptide variant refers to a polypeptide sharing substantially similar structure and having the same biological activity as a reference polypeptide. Variants or analogs differ in the composition of their amino acid sequences compared to the naturally-occurring polypeptide from which the analog is derived, based on one or more mutations involving (i) deletion of one or more amino acid residues at one or more termini of the polypeptide and/or one or more internal regions of the naturally- occurring polypeptide sequence (e.g., fragments), (ii) insertion or addition of one or more amino acids at one or more termini (typically an “addition” or “fusion”) of the polypeptide and/or one or more internal regions (typically an “insertion”) of the naturally-occurring polypeptide sequence or (iii) substitution of one or more amino acids for other amino acids in the naturally-occurring polypeptide sequence. By way of example, a “derivative” refers to a polypeptide sharing the same or substantially similar structure as a reference polypeptide that has been modified, e.g., chemically. [00131] Variant or analog polypeptides include insertion variants, wherein one or more amino acid residues are added to a protein amino acid sequence of the invention. Insertions may be located at either or both termini of the protein, and/or may be positioned within internal regions of the protein amino acid sequence. Insertion variants, with additional residues at either or both termini, include for example, fusion proteins and proteins including amino acid tags or other amino acid labels. In one aspect, the protein molecule optionally contains an N-terminal Met, especially when the molecule is expressed recombinantly in, for example, a yeast, an insect cell or a bacterial cell such as E. coli. [00132] In deletion variants, one or more amino acid residues in a protein or polypeptide as described herein are removed. Deletions can be affected at one or both termini of the protein or polypeptide, and/or with removal of one or more residues within the protein amino acid sequence. Deletion variants, therefore, include fragments of a protein or polypeptide sequence. [00133] In substitution variants, one or more amino acid residues of a protein or polypeptide are removed and replaced with alternative residues. In one aspect, the substitutions are conservative in nature and conservative substitutions of this type are well known in the art. Alternatively, the invention embraces substitutions that are also non-conservative. Exemplary conservative substitutions are described in Lehninger, [Biochemistry, 2nd Edition; Worth Publishers, Inc., New York (1975), pp.71-77], incorporated by reference herein. [00134] The deoxyribonuclease enzyme protein and/or its derivatives, variants or analogs and/or at least one cell comprising a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) or a T cell receptor (TCR) may be administered orally, topically, transdermally, parenterally, by inhalation spray, vaginally, rectally, or by intracranial injection. The term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous injections, intravenous, intramuscular, intracistemal injection, or infusion techniques. Administration by intravenous, intradermal, intramuscular, intramammary, intraperitoneal, intrathecal, retrobulbar, intrapulmonary injection and or surgical implantation at a particular site is contemplated as well. Generally, deoxyribonuclease enzyme protein and/or its derivatives, variants or analogs and/or at least one cell comprising a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) or a T cell receptor (TCR) are essentially free of pyrogens, as well as other impurities that could be harmful to the recipient. [00135] Single or multiple administrations of the deoxyribonuclease enzyme protein and/or its derivatives, variants or analogs and/or at least one cell comprising a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) or a T cell receptor (TCR) can be carried out with the dose levels and pattern being selected by the treating physician. For the prevention or treatment of cancer, the appropriate dosage will depend on the type of disease to be treated, as described above, the severity and course of the cancer, whether drug is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes, previous therapy, the patient's clinical history and response to the drug, and the discretion of the attending physician. [00136] The present invention also relates to a deoxyribonuclease enzyme protein and/or its derivatives, variants or analogs and/or at least one cell comprising a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) or a T cell receptor (TCR) comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent, salt, buffer, or excipient. The pharmaceutical composition can be used for treating clinically- defined disorders. The pharmaceutical composition of the invention may be a solution or a lyophilized product. Solutions of the pharmaceutical composition may be subjected to any suitable lyophilization process. [00137] In other aspects of this embodiment, a deoxyribonuclease enzyme protein and/or its derivatives, variants or analogs disclosed herein reduces the severity of a cancer by, e.g., at least 10%, at least 15%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 30%, at least 35%, at least 40%, at least 45%, at least 50%, at least 55%, at least 60%, at least 65%, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90% or at least 95%. In yet other aspects of this embodiment, a deoxyribonuclease enzyme protein disclosed herein reduces the size of a tumor from, e.g., about 5% to about 100%, about 10% to about 100%, about 20% to about 100%, about 30% to about 100%, about 40% to about 100%, about 50% to about 100%, about 60% to about 100%, about 70% to about 100%, about 80% to about 100%, about 10% to about 90%, about 20% to about 90%, about 30% to about 90%, about 40% to about 90%, about 50% to about 90%, about 60% to about 90%, about 70% to about 90%, about 10% to about 80%, about 20% to about 80%, about 30% to about 80%, about 40% to about 80%, about 50% to about 80%, or about 60% to about 80%, about 10% to about 70%, about 20% to about 70%, about 30% to about 70%, about 40% to about 70%, or about 50% to about 70%.

[00176] A deoxyribonuclease enzyme protein and/or its derivatives, variants or analogs and at least one cell comprising a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) or a T cell receptor (TCR) is administered to an individual. An individual is typically a human being, but can be an animal, including, but not limited to, dogs, cats, birds, cattle, horses, sheep, goats, reptiles and other animals, whether domesticated or not. Typically, any individual who is a candidate for treatment is a candidate with some form of therapy for a disease the individual is suffering, whether the disease is benign or malignant. With regard to cancer’s, the most common types of cancer include, but are not limited to, bladder cancer, breast cancer, colon and rectal cancer, endometrial cancer, kidney cancer, renal cancer, leukemia, lung cancer, melanoma, non- Hodgkins lymphoma, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, stomach cancer and thyroid cancer. Pre-operative evaluation typically includes routine history and physical examination in addition to thorough informed consent disclosing all relevant risks and benefits of the procedure. [00177] In an embodiment, a deoxyribonuclease enzyme protein disclosed herein, or a composition comprising such a therapeutic compound, may be made into a liquid formulation. In an embodiment, liquid formulations suitable for enteral or parenteral administration include, without limitation, solutions, syrups, elixirs, dispersions, emulsions, and suspensions. In an embodiment, a therapeutic compound or composition disclosed herein intended for such administration may be prepared, without limitation, according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions.

[00178] In an embodiment, liquid suspensions may be formulated, without limitation, by suspending a therapeutic compound, including, but not limited to a deoxyribonuclease enzyme protein disclosed herein in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. In an embodiment, such excipients are suspending agents, for example, without limitation, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sodium alginate, pectin, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyvinyl alcohol, natural gum, agar, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting agents may be a naturally occurring phosphatide, for example lecithin, or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids, for example, without limitation, polyoxyethylene stearate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long-chain aliphatic alcohols, for example, without limitation, heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids, for example, without limitation, polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. [00179] As an additional aspect, the invention includes kits which comprise a composition of the invention packaged in a manner which facilitates its use for administration to subjects. In one embodiment, such a kit includes a compound or composition described herein (e.g., a composition comprising a deoxyribonuclease enzyme protein and/or its derivatives, variants or analogs and at least one cell comprising a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) or a T cell receptor (TCR)), packaged in a container such as a sealed bottle or vessel, with a label affixed to the container or included in the package that describes use of the compound or composition in practicing the method. In one embodiment, the kit contains a first container having a composition comprising a deoxyribonuclease enzyme protein and a second container having a physiologically acceptable reconstitution solution for the composition in the first container. In one aspect, the compound or composition is packaged in a unit dosage form. The kit may further include a device suitable for administering the composition according to a specific route of administration. Preferably, the kit contains a label that describes use of the therapeutic protein or peptide composition. [00180] In certain embodiments, a DNase enzyme is formulated in a pharmaceutical composition with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. [00181] The formulations used in the methods of the invention may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by methods known in the art. The amount of active ingredients that can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host being treated and the particular mode of administration. The amount of active ingredients that can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will generally be that amount of the compound which produces a therapeutic effect. [00182] In general, the formulations can be prepared with a liquid carrier, or a finely divided solid carrier, or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product. [00183] Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for parenteral administration may comprise one or more active ingredients (a DNase and, optionally, another compound [e.g., an anti- cancer compound]) in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable sterile isotonic aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions, or sterile powders which may be reconstituted into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use, which may contain antioxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient or suspending or thickening agents. Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers which may be employed in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils, such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters, such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants. [00184] These compositions can also contain preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms may be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents, such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like into the compositions. In addition, prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption, such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin. [00185] Injectable depot forms can be made by forming microencapsule matrices of one or more active ingredients in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending on the ratio of active ingredient to polymer, and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of active ingredient’s release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the active ingredients in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissue. [00186] Formulations for oral administration can be in the form of capsules, cachets, pills, tablets, powders, granules, or as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid (e.g., as a mouthwash, as a composition to be swallowed, or as an enema), or as an oil-in-water or water-in-oil liquid emulsion, and the like, each containing a predetermined amount of one or more active ingredients. [00187] In solid dosage forms for oral administration (capsules, tablets, pills, dragees, powders, granules, and the like), one or more active ingredients can be mixed with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate, and/or any of the following: (1) fillers or extenders, such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and/or silicic acid; (2) binders, such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, sucrose, and/or acacia; (3) humectants, such as glycerol; (4) disintegrating agents, such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate; (5) solution retarding agents, such as paraffin; (6) absorption accelerators, such as quaternary ammonium compounds; (7) wetting agents, such as, for example, cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate; (8) absorbents, such as kaolin and bentonite clay; (9) lubricants, such a talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof; and (10) coloring agents. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the pharmaceutical compositions may also comprise buffering agents. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugars, as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like. [00188] Suspensions, in addition to one or more active ingredients, can contain suspending agents such as ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol, and sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar and tragacanth, and mixtures thereof. [00189] Powders and sprays can contain, in addition to one or more active ingredients, excipients such as lactose, talc, silicic acid, aluminum hydroxide, calcium silicates, and polyamide powder, or mixtures of these substances. Sprays can additionally contain customary propellants, such as chlorofluorohydrocarbons and volatile unsubstituted hydrocarbons, such as butane and propane Cancer and other treatments [00190] In one aspect, the invention provides a method of treating a cancer in a subj ect in need thereof, comprising administering to the subject a deoxyribonuclease enzyme and at least one cell comprising a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) or a T cell receptor (TCR). [00191] In a related aspect, the invention provides a method of treating a cancer in a subject in need thereof, comprising administering to the subject a deoxyribonuclease enzyme and at least one cell comprising a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) or a T cell receptor (TCR), wherein said deoxyribonuclease enzyme is effective to reduce expression of immunosuppressive proteins in tumor tissue and/or increase content of cells comprising a chimeric antigen receptor or T cell receptor within tumor tissue. [00192] The methods of the invention can be used in subjects suffering from a broad range of cancers. Non-limiting examples of relevant cancers include, e.g., breast cancer, prostate cancer, multiple myeloma, transitional cell carcinoma, lung cancer (e.g., non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)), renal cancer, thyroid cancer, leukemia (e.g., chronic myeloid leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia), lymphoma (e.g., B cell lymphoma, T cell lymphoma, non-Hodgkins lymphoma, Hodgkins lymphoma), head and neck cancer, esophageal cancer, stomach cancer, colon cancer, intestinal cancer, colorectal cancer, rectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, liver cancer, cancer of the bile duct, cancer of the gall bladder, ovarian cancer, uterine endometrial cancer, vaginal cancer, cervical cancer, bladder cancer, neuroblastoma, sarcoma, osteosarcoma, malignant melanoma, squamous cell cancer, bone cancer, including both primary bone cancers (e.g., osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, Ewing’s sarcoma, fibrosarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, adamantinoma, giant cell tumor, and chordoma) and secondary (metastatic) bone cancers, soft tissue sarcoma, basal cell carcinoma, angiosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma, myxosarcoma, liposarcoma, osteogenic sarcoma, angiosarcoma, endotheliosarcoma, lymphangiosarcoma, lymphangioendotheliosarcoma, synovioma, testicular cancer, uterine cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, mesothelioma, leiomyosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, adenocarcinoma, sweat gland carcinoma, sebaceous gland carcinoma, papillary carcinoma, Waldenstroom’s macroglobulinemia, papillary adenocarcinomas, cystadenocarcinoma, bronchogenic carcinoma, choriocarcinoma, seminoma, embryonal carcinoma, Wilms’ tumor, epithelial carcinoma, glioma, glioblastoma, astrocytoma, medulloblastoma, craniopharyngioma, ependymoma, pinealoma, hemangioblastoma, acoustic neuroma, oligodendroglioma, meningioma, retinoblastoma, medullary carcinoma, thymoma, sarcoma, etc. [00193] In some embodiments of any of the methods of the invention, the subject is human.

PMID: 30443597; PMCID: PMC6235538) on day 10 after tumor inoculation; Group “CAR19 with DNase I”: single IV injection of 3 x 10 untransduced human CD8 T cells transduced with lentiviral vector coding for CD 19 CAR [FMC63 scFv/IgG4hinge/IgG4 CH2- CH3/CD28TM/OX-40/CD3z] on day 10 after tumor inoculation plus ten daily IV injections of human recombinant DNase I enzyme at 4 mg/kg dose starting on day 10 after tumor inoculation. [00196] Tumor volume was measured with calipers and estimated using the ellipsoidal formula. The data are shown in Figure 1. The data clearly show that IV injections of human recombinant DNase I enzyme provide statistically significant (p<0.05) efficacy boost for CD19 CAR T cells. Example 2. AAV gene transfer of deoxyribonuclease enzyme increases recruitment of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) bearing T cells into tumor tissue and reduces local immunosuppression [00197] AAV-DNase I vector was produced as descried in Xia Y, He J, Zhang H, et al. AAV- mediated gene transfer of DNase I in the liver of mice with colorectal cancer reduces liver metastasis and restores local innate and adaptive immune response [published online ahead of print, 2020 Aug 19 \ Mol Oncol. 2020; 14(11):2920-2935. doi:l 0.1002/1878-0261.12787. Briefly, AAV-DNase I vector was produced using polyethylenimine triple plasmid transfections of rep/cap plasmid encoding the Anc80L65 capsid, pCLS-014, and adenovirus helper plasmids in HEK293 cells with further purification on an iodixanol gradient at scale. The plasmid pAAV-ApoEHCR enhancer-hAAT promoter-hDNase I (hyperactive)-WPRE Xinact (pCLS-014) specifically comprised a transgene expression cassette consisting of (a) apolipoprotein E-hepatic control region (APOE-HCR enhancer) and human alpha- 1 -antitrypsin (hAAT) promoter, (b) a Kozak sequence, (c) human hyperactive, actin resistant, DNase I- variant containing the natural signal sequence, (d) a woodchuck hepatitis virus posttranscriptional element (WPRE) with the X protein coding region inactivated by mutating the start codon. The purified AAV-DNase I vector was reformulated in PBS supplemented with 35 mM NaCl and 0.001% Pluronic F68, and the titer (genome copies [GC] per mL) was determined by quantitative PCR. The purified AAV vector was analyzed by SDS/PAGE, with three bands of 60, 72, and 90 kDa observed in a ratio of ~ 1 : 1 : 10, which corresponds to the VP 1-3 proteins. AAV-null contained all the components of CLS-014 transgene expression cassette, with the exception that it was devoid of DNase I cDNA. [00198] A scFv of monoclonal antibody specific to CEA has been generated using proprietary sc fv phage display library. A scFv along with a CD8a hinge, CD28 transmembrane domain, plus CD3ζ and CD28 signaling domains were cloned into a pMS3 retroviral vector. Mouse CEA targeting CAR T cells has been generated as described in Wang L, Ma N, Okamoto S, et al. Efficient tumor regression by adoptively transferred CEA-specific CAR-T cells associated with symptoms of mild cytokine release syndrome. Oncoimmunology . 2016;5(9):el211218. Published 2016 Jul 25. doi:10.1080/2162402X.2016.1211218. Whole spleen cells (1.5 x 10 7 cells/5 mL) from C57BL/6 (CD45.1) congeneric mice were stimulated with immobilized anti-CD3 (1 mg/mL; 145-2C11) and soluble anti-CD28 (1 mg/mL; 37.51) in one well of a six-well plate. One day after the stimulation (on day 1), 5 x 10 5 cells were transduced with the viral vector by using the RetroNectin-bound virus infection method, wherein virus solutions were preloaded onto Retro-Nectin (Takara Bio)-coated wells of a 24- well plate containing 1 mL culture medium. On day 3, the cells were transferred to a 50 mL flask containing 10 mL culture medium for expansion. On day 5, the cells were harvested and used for experiments. Recombinant human IL-2 (Novartis) at 60 IU/mL was added during culturing. [00199] To establish the liver metastasis models, the anesthetized C57BL/6 mice were placed in a supine position. After disinfecting the skin in the area of surgery, a median abdominal incision was performed followed by mobilization of the duodenum to identify the portal vein. One million CEA+ MC32a cells were injected into the portal vein using a 30-G needle. After removal of the needle, bleeding was stopped by gently pressing the puncture site with a cotton swab. After injection, the intestine was repositioned and the abdominal wall was closed with nonabsorbable sutures. [00200] On day 5 after the tumor challenge the mice (7 animals per group) were randomly assigned into 4 groups: Group “Control”: control tumor bearing mice; Group “CAR19”: IV injection of 5 x 10 6 CAR-T cells; Group “AAV-DNase I”: IV injection of AAV-DNase I vector at 1.5x 10 12 GC per mouse; Group “CAR19 with AAV-DNase I”: IV injection of 5 / 10 6 CAR-T cells in combination with AAV-DNase I vector at 1.5x 10 12 GC per mouse dose. [00201] The survival graph is presented in Figure 2. The data in Figure 2 clearly shows meaningful survival (p<0.05) benefit from a combination of CAR T ceils and AAV DNase I gene transfer. [00202] At day 15, one animal from each of groups “control”, “CAR19”, and “CAR19 with AAV-DNase I” was euthanized (one mouse per group) and livers were harvested for examination. Metastatic tissue was analyzed by flow cytometry [as described in Xia Y, He J, Zhang H, et al. AAV-mediated gene transfer of DNase I in the liver of mice with colorectal cancer reduces liver metastasis and restores local innate and adaptive immune response. Mol Oncol. 2020; 14(11):2920-2935. doi:l 0.1002/1878-0261.12787] for PD LI expression using anti-PD-Ll antibody (clone 10F.9G2, Merck) and prevalence of CEA targeting CAR T cells using biotinylated protein L and streptavidin conjugated with FITC. [00203] Figure 3 shows percentage of metastatic MC32a cells expressing PD LI. Data show meaningful suppression of PD LI expression (p<0.05) in metastatic MC32a cells from metastatic lesions from mice treated with combination of CAR T cells and AAV-DNase I gene transfer. [00204] Figure 4 shows percentage of CEA targeting CAR T cells in parenchyma of MC32a metastatic lesions. Data show meaningful increase (p<0.05) of number of CAR T cells in metastatic lesions from mice treated with combination of CAR T cells and AAV DNase I gene transfer. Example 3. Development of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) bearing T cells expressing deoxyribonuclease enzyme [00205] Human peripheral blood T cells from healthy donors were engineered with a FL1 CAR comprising CILDLPKFC/IgGl Fc spacer domain ("CILDLPKFC" is disclosed as SEQ ID NO: 59), a GGGS linker (SEQ ID NO: 60), a CD28 transmembrane and intracellular region, and intracellular domains of the OX-40 and CD3zeta (Stepanov et al., Autocrine-based selection of ligands for personalized CAR-T therapy of lymphoma. Sci Adv. 2018, 4(1 l):eaau4580; doi:10.1126/sciadv.aau4580) with or without the gene of full-length human hyperactive actin resistant mutant DNase I (SEQ ID NO: 5) through self-cleavage peptide P2A. See Figure 5. [00206] The DNase activity was analyzed using fluorescent probe (Terekhov et al., PNAS 2017, 114(10):2550-2555) in culture media of FLl-CAR-T cells, DNase I FLl-CAR-T cells and untransduced control T cells during 6-hour incubation of cells in complete RPMI 1640 media supplemented with human IL-2 (40 U/ml). All the experiments were performed in triplicate. Data are presented in Figure 6. The data show gradual increase of DNase activity in culture media of DNase I FLl-CAR-T cells. [00207] The cytotoxicity and specificity of engineered T cells were evaluated in a standard LDH release assay (CytoTox 96 Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay, Promega) following the manufacturer’s recommendations. FL1-CAR-T cells, DNase I FL1-CAR-T cells and untransduced control T cells were co-incubated for 6 hours together with 10^ of the Raji-FLl cells in complete RPMI 1640 media supplemented with human IL-2 (40 U/ml). All the experiments were performed in triplicate. [00208] The data are shown in Figure 7. The data clearly show that reprogramming of T cells to simultaneously express CAR and deoxyribonuclease enzyme provide superior cytotoxicity against target lymphoma cells (p<0.01). Example 4. Biological activity of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) bearing T cells expressing deoxyribonuclease enzyme [00209] Six- to eight- week-old female NOD SCID (CB17-Prkdc scid /NcrCrl) mice with an average weight of 16 to 20 g were used. Tumors were engrafted by inoculating 5x 10 6 Raji-FLl CAR cells in 200 μl of 0.9% saline solution subcutaneously into the left side of mice. Once tumors had reached a palpable volume of at least 50 mm 3 , mice were randomly assigned and treated as follows: At days 10 and 15, tumor-bearing mice were injected intravenously with 3 x 10 6 aFLl CAR T cells (Group 2; six mice), 3 x 10 6 aFLl CART cells expressing hyperactive actin resistant mutant DNase I (SEQ ID NO: 5) (Group 3, 6 mice) and placebo control (Group 1; 6 mice). Tumor volume was measured with calipers and estimated using the ellipsoidal formula. Animals were euthanized on day 20. [00210] The data are shown in Figure 8. The data clearly show that reprogramming of T cells to simultaneously express a CAR and a DNase enzyme provide superior efficacy for such dual reprogrammed T cells (p<0.05). Example 5. Treatment with DNase increases efficacy of CAR-T cell therapy [00211] Human peripheral blood T cells from healthy donors were engineered with a CD 19 CAR comprising FMC63 scFv/IgG4hinge/IgG4 CH2-CH3/CD28TM/OX-40/CD3z (as described in Stepanov et al., Autocrine-based selection of ligands for personalized CAR-T therapy of lymphoma. Sci Adv. 2018, 4(1 l):eaau4580. doi:10.1126/sciadv.aau4580). Six- to eight-week-old female NOD SCID (CB17-Prkdc scid /NcrCrl) mice with an average weight of 16 to 20 g were used. Tumors were engrafted by inoculating 5x 10 6 Raji-CD19 CAR cells in 200 μl of 0.9% saline solution subcutaneously into the left side of mice. Once tumors had reached a palpable volume of at least 50 mm 3 , mice were randomly assigned and treated as follows: at days 10 and 15, tumor-bearing mice were injected intravenously with CD 19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells at a dose of 0.5 x 10 6 CAR-T cells/kg alone or in combinations with different DNase I regimens (human recombinant DNase I enzyme (Kevelt AS; SEQ ID NO: 4), administered by i.v. injection). Animals were randomized to different groups: Group 1 (n = 5 mice) - treatment with CD 19 CAR-T cells; Group 2 (n = 5 mice) - treatment with CD 19 CAR-T cells + DNase I 500 μg/kg 1 time, 24h before the initiation of CAR-T cell therapy; Group 3 (n = 5 mice) - treatment with CD 19 CAR-T cells + DNase I 1000 μg/kg 2 times, 24h before the initiation of CAR-T cell therapy and 24h after; Group 4 (n = 5 mice) - treatment with CD 19 CAR-T cells + DNase I 1000 μg/kg 2 times, 72h before the initiation of CAR-T cell therapy and 30 days after; Group 5 (n = 5 mice) - treatment with CD 19 CAR-T cells + DNase I 250 μg/kg, 3 days prior to the initiation of CAR-T cell therapy; Group 6 (n = 5 mice) - treatment with CD 19 CAR-T cells + DNase 12500 μg/kg, 1 day before and daily for 6 days starting from the initiation of CAR-T cell therapy; Group 7 (n = 5 mice) - treatment with CD 19 CAR-T cells + DNase I 500 μg/kg 1 time, 7 days before the initiation of CAR-T cell therapy; Group 8 (n = 5 mice) - treatment with CD 19 CAR-T cells + DNase I 500 μg/kg 1 time, 7 days before the initiation of CAR-T cell therapy and, after the initiation of CAR-T cell therapy, weekly for the next 8 weeks; Group 9 (n = 5 mice) - treatment with CD 19 CAR-T cells + DNase I 1500 μg/kg 1 time, 28 days before the initiation of CAR-T cell therapy. Clinical efficacy and side effects were monitored. [00212] Figure 9 shows flow cytometry detection of CAR-T cells in peripheral blood using biotinylated protein L and streptavidin conjugated with FITC (see Stepanov et al., Autocrine- based selection of ligands for personalized CAR-T therapy of lymphoma. Sci Adv. 2018, 4(11):eaau4580. doi: 10.1126/sciadv.aau4580). The data demonstrate that the combined use of DNase and CAR-T cell therapy significantly (for all p<0.05) increases the persistence of CAR T cells in blood. [00213] Figure 10 demonstrates that the combined use of DNase and CAR-T cell therapy increases animal survival. All tested combinations of DNase I with CD19 CAR-T cells treatment show significant superiority to CD 19 CAR-T cells treatment alone. Pretreatment of mice with high dose DNase I in group 9 produced particular advantage which might be linked to more extensive preconditioning of tumor microenvironment prior to CD 19 CAR-T cells treatment. Example 6. Treatment with DNase decreases cytokine release syndrome associated with CAR-T cell therapy [00214] To model cytokine release syndrome (CRS) we used 6-8 week old female C.B.Igh- lb/GbmsTac-Prkdc scid Lyst bg N7 (SCID) mice (Charles River) were intraperitoneally injected with 3x10 6 Raji cells. 3x10 7 CD19 CAR-T cells (same as in Example 5) were injected intraperitoneally on the 25 th day after tumor growth. CAR-T cells were administered alone or in combinations with different DNase I regimens (human recombinant DNase I enzyme (Kevelt AS; SEQ ID NO: 4), administered by i.v. injection). Animals were randomized to different groups: Group 1 (n = 5 mice) - treatment with CAR-T cells; Group 2 (n = 5 mice) - treatment with CAR-T cells + DNase I 500 μg/kg 1 time, 24h before the initiation of CAR-T cell therapy; Group 3 (n = 5 mice) - treatment with CAR-T cells + DNase I 1000 μg/kg 24h after the initiation of CAR-T cell therapy; Group 4 (n = 5 mice) - treatment with CAR-T cells + DNase I 1000 μg/kg 2 times, 72h before the initiation of CAR-T cell therapy; Group 5 (n = 5 mice) - treatment with CAR-T cells + DNase I 500 μg/kg 1 time, 7 days before the initiation of CAR-T cell therapy; Group 6 (n = 5 mice) - treatment with CAR-T cells + DNase I 1500 μg/kg 1 time, 28 days before the initiation of CAR-T cell therapy. [00215] The data on % of animals with CRS shown in Figure 11 demonstrates that the use of DNase increases safety of CAR-T therapy and protects from CAR-T-related side effects.
