BACKGROUND [0004] Drug treatment of fibrotic diseases and liver diseases remains elusive as evidenced by the high mortality rates of these diseases. Currently, cessation of the damaging activity or disease is the primary method for treating fibrosis, e.g., of the liver, and liver disease. Therefore, a need exists for pharmaceutical therapies to treat fibrotic diseases and liver diseases. SUMMARY [0005] The disclosure relates to telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) therapies for the treatment of fibrotic diseases and conditions, e.g. of the liver, and liver diseases and conditions.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE [0054] All publications, patents, and patent applications mentioned in this specification are herein incorporated by reference to the same extent as if each individual publication, patent, or patent application was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [0055] The novel features of the disclosure are set forth with particularity in the appended claims. A better understanding of the features and advantages of the present disclosure will be obtained by reference to the following detailed description that sets forth illustrative embodiments, in which the principles of the disclosure are utilized, and the accompanying drawings of which: [0056] FIG. 1 is a schematic illustrating long-term therapeutic benefit from transient, rapid telomere extension via telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) mRNA. In particular, the speed of telomere extension made possible by TERT mRNA treatment enables telomere maintenance by very infrequent TERT mRNA dosing. The telomerase activity resulting from TERT mRNA delivery rapidly extends telomeres in a brief period, before the mRNA is turned over, thus allowing the protective anti-cancer mechanism of telomere-shortening to function most of the time. Between treatments, normal telomerase activity and telomere shortening is present, and therefore the anti-cancer safety mechanism of telomere shortening to prevent out- of-control proliferation remains intact, while the risk of short telomere-related disease remains low. In contrast, the best existing small molecule treatment for extending telomeres requires chronic delivery, and thus presents a chronic cancer risk, and even then has a small, inconsistent effect on telomere length, with no detectable effect on telomere length at all in about half of patients. [0057] FIG.2 is a series of graphs showing that TERT mRNA LNPs exhibit low toxicity by liver panel. Mice were dosed intravenously with reporter mRNA encapsulated in a lipid nanoparticle employing either LNP1 or LNP2, as shown in Table 5 (N=1-4 per condition). Mice were sacrificed and blood was collected at the time points indicated (12, 24, and 72 hours). Mice receiving saline (N=4) and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4, N=4) served as negative and positive controls, respectively. Error bars display standard error of the mean. [0058] FIG. 3 is a series of photographs showing that TERT mRNA LNPs cause normal histology. Cre mRNA was encapsulated into LNP 1 (Table 5) and delivered intravenously (i.v.) into tdTomato fl/fl mice. Organs were harvested 72 hours later, fixed, paraffin embedded, and sectioned. Organs from an untreated tdTomato fl/fl mouse are shown for reference. [0059] FIG. 4 is a series of photographs showing that TERT mRNA LNPs transfect hepatocytes with high efficiency. Cre mRNA was encapsulated into LNP 1 (Table 5) and delivered intravenously (i.v.) into tdTomato fl/fl mice. Organs were harvested 72 hours later, fixed, paraffin embedded, and sectioned. Photographs depict immunohistochemistry (IHC) with anti-tdTomato. Organs from an untreated tdTomato fl/fl mouse are shown for reference. [0060] FIG. 5 is a series of photographs showing that TERT mRNA LNPs also target some cells in spleen. Cre mRNA was encapsulated into LNP 1 (Table 5) and delivered intravenously (i.v.) into tdTomato fl/fl mice. Organs were harvested 72 hours later, fixed, paraffin embedded, and sectioned. Photographs depict immunohistochemistry (IHC) with anti-tdTomato. Organs from an untreated tdTomato fl/fl mouse are shown for reference. [0061] FIG. 6 is a pair of graphs showing that TERT mRNA LNPs cause high telomerase activity in liver. Tert mRNA was formulated with LNP1 or LNP2 (Table 5) and delivered to i.v into TERT KO mice. 20 hours later, the livers were harvested for telomerase repeat amplification protocol (TRAP). Wild-type C57Bl6/J and untreated TERT KO mouse livers were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. [0062] FIG.7 is a photograph depicting the results of an assaying demonstrating that luciferase mRNA LNPs cause high bioluminescence signal in liver. Various LNPs designated as Lipid Nanoparticle 1 (LNP1), Lipid Nanoparticle 2 (LNP2), or Lipid Nanoparticle 3 (LNP3) (Table 5). Empty LNP shown as a negative control (ctrl). Luciferase mRNA was formulated with LNP 1, 2, and 3 and delivered via IV injection into C57Bl6/J mice.20 hours later, these mice were shaved and imaged after injection with luciferin using the IVIS BLI system. [0063] FIG.8 is a graph and a series of photographs of a first study demonstrating that TERT LNPs reduce fibrosis in thioacetamide (TAA) drinking water model. The addition of thioacetamide (TAA) to drinking water represents an art-recognized model for the induction of experimental liver fibrosis in rodents (Wallace MC, Hamesch K, Lunova M, et al. Standard operating procedures in experimental liver research: thioacetamide model in mice and rats. Lab Anim 2015;49:21-9). In this experiment, TERT KO mice received 0.3 g/L TAA in their drinking water for 9.5 weeks. Mice were treated with LNPs carrying either Tert mRNA or Luciferase (LUC) mRNA once weekly. Liver sections were stained with Picrosirius red (PSR), and a quantification of showed a 24% mean reduction in PSR stained tissue in mice treated with TERT LNPs compared to those treated with LUC LNPs. Scale bar on photographs equals 500 µm. [0064] FIGS. 9A AND 9B are graphs and photographs of a study demonstrating that TERT LNPs Reduce Fibrosis in a Thioacetamide (TAA) Drinking Water Model. TERT KO mice received 0.3 g/L TAA in their drinking water for 9.4 weeks and were treated with TERT or LUC mRNA- LNPs once weekly. By picrosirius red (PSR) staining, there was an 18% mean reduction in fibrosis in female mice and a 37% mean reduction was observed in males treated with TERT mRNA-LNPs, representing a significant (p=0.041) reduction in fibrosis. The scale bar on photographs is 500 µm. Additionally, using the 0 through 4 scoring system developed by the Pathology Committee of the NASH Clinical Research Network (Kleiner et al Hepatology 2005), animals treated with TERT mRNA LNPs had a significant reduction in fibrosis compared to control animals treated with LUC (luciferase) mRNA LNPs (p=0.032) as seen in FIG 9B. For all scoring, liver fibrosis was scored independently for each of 3 lobes per mouse (right, median, and left) in a blinded manner. The scores were averaged together to get a score per mouse, which were then plotted in the graphs (FIGS.8, 9A, and 9B). [0065] FIGS.10A AND 10B are graphs demonstrating that TERT mRNA improves survival. Survival plotted as fraction of mice alive as a function of days post first dose of either TERT or a Luciferase (Luc) negative control. Same experimental procedure was followed as described in FIG.9, except that the mice were 4 th generation (G4) TERT KOs aged to over 30 weeks at the start of the study. These mice were dosed once weekly with TERT or LUC, and survival was recorded after the first dose. TERT treated mice showed a 42% increase in median survival and a 58% increase in maximal survival. FIG.10B shows the survival of a group of aged mice that did not receive thioacetamide (TAA) in drinking water (no TAA). [0066] FIGS.11A AND 11B show the effects of TERT mRNA on pathological liver fibrosis in mice. FIG.11A shows the assessment of pathological fibrosis in liver sections from TERT knockout mice with TAA-induced liver fibrosis, as described in FIG. 9, by a certified pathologist based on the Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) Activity Score (NAS). TERT knockout mice without TAA-induced liver fibrosis (saline IV) exhibited a mild inflammation score of 1 (< 2 foci per 200x field of view). Untreated control mice (C57Bl/6 strain) exhibited no detectable inflammation. FIG.11B shows inflammation was significantly reduced in TERT knockout mice treated with TERT mRNA compared to the control (LUC): TERT mRNA treatment resulted in a 60% reduction in the number of animals with a score of >1. [0067] FIGS. 12A AND 12B show the transfection efficiency of mRNA in liver. FIG. 12A shows the quantification of percent (%) positive hepatocytes after different doses of Cre mRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticle using ionizable lipid 1 (LNP1) delivered intravenously to tdTomato fl/fl (HTT flox/flox) mice. Hepatocytes were identified in liver tissue sections using nuclear size and circularity by QuPath software. The experimental design was the same as for FIGS. 3-5. FIG. 12B is representative images of immunohistochemistry (IHC) using an anti- tdTomato antibody in liver sections. [0068] FIG.13 shows levels of liver damage makers following TERT mRNA delivery. TERT mRNA was formulated with LNP1 or D-Lin-MC3-DMA (MC3) and delivered intravenously into C57Bl6 mice at 0.6 mg/kg. 24 hours later, the plasma was taken for measurement of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). TERT-LNP1 had equivalent or lower levels of ALT and AST compared to MC3. These liver enzymes serve as markers of acute toxicity. [0069] FIGS.14 AND 14B shows the transfection efficiency in fibrotic liver. FIG.14 A shows the quantification of percent (%) positive hepatocytes following delivery of Cre mRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticle using LNP1 to tdTomato fl/fl mice after 16 weeks of treatment with thioacetamide (TAA) in drinking water at 0.3g/L. Hepatocytes were identified using nuclear size and circularity by QuPath software. The experimental design was the same as for FIGS. 3-5. FIG. 12B: is representative immunohistochemical (IHC) images using an anti-tdTomato antibody in liver sections. [0070] FIGS.15A AND 15B shows telomere extension in liver. The experimental design is as follows: 3 doses of either TERT mRNA (SEQ ID NO: 37) or luciferase (LUC) mRNA formulated with LNP1 were delivered to TERT KO mice intravenously once weekly at 0.5 mg/kg. The mRNA-LNP dosing was preceded two days prior by a dose of thioacetamide intraperitoneally (i.p.) at 50mg/kg. Mice were harvested 1 week after the final dose of mRNA- LNP. Telomere length was quantified in hepatocytes using Q-FISH. Liver tissue was fixed, sectioned, and stained with TelC fluorescent probe that labels the telomeres. Individual telomere fluorescence was quantified on a per cell basis and the average was taken for each mouse. The median fluorescence is shown in FIG. 15A and 10th percentile fluorescence is shown in FIG. 15B. Each point represents a single mouse. Hepatocytes in mice treated with TERT mRNA had significantly longer telomeres than LUC mRNA treated control animals. At least 300 cells were analyzed per mouse per treatment group. [0071] FIGS. 16A AND 16B show telomerase activity in human hepatocytes. Human hepatocytes from a 51-year-old donor cultured were transfected with green fluorescent protein (GFP) mRNA or TERT mRNA using Messenger Max from Thermo Scientific at 1 µg/ml. Cells were harvested for each time point indicated in FIG. 16A for the TRAP assay to measure telomerase activity. Telomerase activity produces a ladder pattern that was detected using an Agilent Bioanalyzer. Telomerase activity returned to baseline by day 14. [0072] FIGS. 17A AND 17B show that telomere length was quantified from human hepatocytes from a 51-year-old donor. In the experimental design human hepatocytes were cultured on glass coverslips. Cells were transfected once with TERT mRNA at 1 µg/ml using Messenger Max from Thermo Scientific or left untreated (UT). Cells were fixed and stained with TelC fluorescent probe using the Q-FISH protocol. Individual telomere fluorescence was quantified on a per cell level. The mean fluorescence is shown in FIG. 17A and the 10th percentile fluorescence is shown in Fig 17B. At least 150 cells were analyzed per treatment group. [0073] FIGS. 18A AND 18B show TERT mRNA (SEQ ID NO: 40) formulated with LNP1 and imaged at high resolution using the Thermo Scientific Talos Glacios Cryo transmission electron microscope (TEM) at 34,000 magnification and 200kv voltage. A representative image is show in FIG.18A; the TEM copper grid is the dark region on the right. The particle size was characterized using dynamic light scattering (DLS) using a Brookhaven 90Plus Particle Analyzer as shown in FIG.18B. [0074] FIG.19 shows results of the telomerase activity assay “telomerase repeat amplification protocol” (TRAP) in human fibroblasts treated for 24 hours with 1 µg/ml TERT mRNAs of from left to right, untreated cells, SEQ ID NOS:39, 40, 1, 2, 31, 3, 5, and 4 respectively, and a GFP mRNA control. Telomerase activity is indicated by a characteristic ladder pattern as shown by the transfection of TERT mRNAs of SEQ ID NOS: 39, 40,1, 2, 31, 3, 5, and 4 to varying degrees. The samples transfected with human TERT mRNA showed higher levels of telomerase activity than the samples transfected with mouse TERT mRNA. Untreated and GFP mRNA samples did exhibit telomerase activity. [0075] FIG 20 shows in vivo delivery of mRNA in a photograph depicting the results demonstrating that luciferase mRNA LNPs cause high bioluminescence signal in liver. Luciferase mRNA was formulated with SS-OP using the lipid ratios for LNP1, as shown in Table 5. The lipid : mRNA ratios (wt/wt) were varied. The formulated mRNA LNPs were delivered via IV injection into C57Bl6/J mice at 0.6 mg/kg. As a negative control, a mouse was injected with saline. 24 hours later, these mice were shaved and imaged after injection with luciferin using the Lago instrument from Spectral Instruments Imaging. Depicted is an BLI image from mice dosed with lipid:mRNA ratios of 175, 42, and 25. The signal was highest in the mice receiving LNPs with a lipid:mRNA ratio (wt/wt) of 175 and 42. The other data presented here using LNP1 uses a wt/wt ratio of 42. [0076] FIG 21 shows in vivo delivery of mRNA in a photograph depicting the results demonstrating that luciferase mRNA LNPs causing high bioluminescence signal in liver. LNPs designated as Lipid Nanoparticle 4 (LNP4) or Lipid Nanoparticle 5 (LNP5) were formulated using the recipe in Table 5 with luciferase mRNA. These LNPs were delivered via IV injection into C57Bl6/J mice at 0.6mg/kg. As a negative control, a mouse was injected with saline. 20 hours later, these mice were shaved and imaged after injection with luciferin using the Lago instrument from Spectral Instruments Imaging. LNP4 consisted of the formula for LNP2, but with SS-OP substituted for cKK-E12. LNP5 consisted of the formula for LNP1, but with cKK- E12 substituted for SS-OP. Bioluminescent imaging indicates that both of these LNPs had successful delivery to the liver. [0077] FIG 22 shows in vivo delivery of mRNA in a photograph depicting the results demonstrating that luciferase mRNA LNPs causing high bioluminescence signal in liver. Luciferase mRNA was formulated with lipids per the recipe for LNP1 in Table 5. The ingredient that was varied was the molar ratio of DMG-PEG2000. As shown in FIG.22, DMG- PEG2000 was added as either 1, 1.5, 2, or 3 parts relative to the molar sum of all lipids, while the molar ratio for the other 3 lipids is held constant. This corresponds to a molar percentage for DMG-PEG2000 of approximately 1.0%, 1.5%, 2.0%, and 2.9%.20 hours after intravenous delivery at 0.6mg/kg, the C57BL/6J mice were shaved and imaged following luciferin injection using the Lago instrument from Spectral Instruments Imaging. The signal was strong from all of the mice receiving active Luciferase mRNA LNPs, and the best signal was seen when DMG- PEG2000 was added in a molar ratio of 1.5 : 101.5 for a total of (~1.5%). The other data presented here use LNP1 with this molar ratio of DMG-PEG2000. [0078] FIG 23 is a capillary electrophoresis gel image showing that TERT mRNA LNPs cause high telomerase activity in liver. Tert mRNA (mTert SEQ 37) was formulated with LNP3, a lipid nanoparticle containing DLin-MC3-DMA (Table 5) and delivered i.v into TERT KO mice at 0.6mg/kg.16 hours or 8 days later (as indicated in the image), the livers were harvested for telomerase repeat amplification protocol (TRAP). The negative control was a TRAP performed on a liver from a TERT KO mouse that was injected with saline. Livers from mice treated with TERT mRNA LNP3 exhibit elevated telomerase activity which returns to baseline levels, indicating the increase in telomerase activity was transient. DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0079] Provided herein are compositions and methods that may be used for preventing or treating fibrotic diseases and liver diseases or disorders. The present disclosure describes the surprising result that compositions comprising an mRNA encoding telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) reduce liver fibrosis. TERT mRNA therapies as described herein may be delivered in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), or by other delivery vehicles. Diseases that may be treated include, without limitation, fibrotic diseases, e.g. of the liver, and other liver diseases. [0080] Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) is an enzyme known to maintain and extend chromosomal ends (telomeres). The TERT enzyme is a catalytic subunit of the ribonucleoprotein telomerase. TERT adds simple sequence repeats to telomeres by copying a template sequence 5’-GGTTAG-3’ within the RNA component of telomerase. This addition of repetitive deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequences helps slow telomere shortening, which occurs over time, e.g., due to incomplete DNA replication during mitosis. [0081] TERT translocates between the nucleus and cytoplasm and has been shown to be a critical factor in a number of other biological processes, including cell proliferation and cancer metastasis. Thus, the level of TERT in the nucleus may be a critical step in regulating cell and organismal health. [0082] Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) is also known in the art as TRT, cutaneous malignant melanoma 9 (CMM9), dyskeratosis congenita autosomal dominant 2 (DKCA2), autosomal recessive dyskeratosis congenita-4 (DKCB4), human ever shorter telomeres 2 (HEST2), pulmonary fibrosis/bone marrow failure telomere related 1 (PFBMFT1), telomerase catalytic subunit (TCS1), and telomerase associated protein 2 (TP2). [0083] In some embodiments, the treatments described herein may stop, slow, or reverse progression of a fibrotic disease, e.g., a liver disease, or other liver diseases. [0084] TERT mRNA is transient and only requires a few hours to extend telomeres in human cells before being degraded. Therefore, TERT mRNA leaves the protective anti-cancer telomere shortening mechanism intact. The present disclosure provides compositions and methods for delivery of TERT mRNA and treatment of fibrotic diseases and liver diseases. [0085] During normal aging, telomeres shorten by approximately 30–100 base pairs per year due to oxidation and incomplete DNA replication during S phase of the cell cycle (Kurenova EV, et al. Telomere functions. A review. Biochemistry (Mosc) 1997; 62:1242-53). Telomerase, consisting of the TERT protein and a polynucleotide template (TERC), extends telomeres, but in humans, it is inactive in most somatic cell types and is only active at low levels that are insufficient to prevent net telomere shortening in many progenitor cell types. The exception is the spermatogenic lineage, in which telomerase is active enough to maintain telomere length over the human lifespan (Takubo K, Aida J, Izumiyama- Shimomura N, et al. Changes of telomere length with aging. Geriatric Gerontology Int 2010; 10 Suppl 1:S197-206). As the TERC component is present at high levels in all cell types, typically over 10,000 copies per cell, TERT is the limiting component. Because short telomeres limit the proliferative and regenerative capacities of cells, they are associated with aging, early death, and a vast number of diseases and conditions. [0086] Telomeres comprise repetitive DNA sequences at the ends of linear chromosomes that, when sufficiently long, can allow each chromosome end to form a loop that protects the ends from acting as double-stranded or single-stranded DNA breaks. Telomeres can shorten over time, due in part to oxidative damage and incomplete DNA replication, eventually leading to critically short telomeres unable to form the protective loop, exposure of the chromosome ends, chromosome-chromosome fusions, DNA damage responses, and cellular senescence, apoptosis, or malignancy. [0087] Telomere length maintenance can play a role in preventing cellular senescence and apoptosis and resulting cellular and organ dysfunction. In many diseases, the need for cell replication to replace cells damaged or killed by the underlying disease mechanism shortens telomeres more rapidly than normal, exhausting the replicative capacity of cells, and leading to tissue dysfunction, exacerbated or additional symptoms, disability, or death. Further, genetic mutations of telomerase enzyme (TERT) can be linked to fatal inherited diseases of inadequate telomere maintenance. [0088] The prospect of preventing, delaying, or treating dysfunction, conditions, and diseases by telomere extension motivates a need for safe and effective treatments to extend telomeres in animal cells in vivo and/or in vitro, and safe and effective compositions and methods for delivering therapies to the animal cells to extend telomeres. Further, there is a need to safely and rapidly extend telomeres in cells for use in cell therapy, cell and tissue engineering, and regenerative medicine. At the same time, however, there can be a danger in the constitutive, as opposed to transient, activation of telomerase activity. Indeed, for cell therapy applications, there is a need to avoid cell immortalization. To this end, transient, rather than constitutive, telomerase activity can be advantageous for safety, e.g., if the elevated telomerase activity is not only brief but extends telomeres rapidly enough that the treatment does not need to be repeated continuously. [0089] Thus, there is need for therapies that safely extend telomeres to potentially prevent, delay, ameliorate, or treat these and other conditions and diseases, to do the same for the gradual decline in physical form and function and mental function that accompanies chronological aging, and to enable cell therapies and regenerative medicine. Furthermore, there is need for improved methods of delivering these therapies, e.g., nucleic acid molecules encoding telomerase, to cells. [0090] Unless otherwise defined herein, scientific and technical terms used in this application shall have the meanings that are commonly understood by those of ordinary skill in the art. Generally, nomenclature used in connection with, and techniques of, chemistry, molecular biology, cell and cancer biology, immunology, microbiology, pharmacology, and protein and nucleic acid chemistry, described herein, are those well-known and commonly used in the art. [0091] It must be noted that, as used herein and in the appended claims, the singular forms “a,” “and,” and “the” include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to “a drug candidate” refers to one or mixtures of such candidates, and reference to “the method” includes reference to equivalent steps and methods known to those skilled in the art, and so forth. [0092] As used herein, the term “approximately” or “about,” as applied to one or more values of interest, refers to a value that is similar in magnitude and/or within a similar range to a stated reference value. In certain embodiments, the term “approximately” or “about” may refer to a range of values that fall within 25%, 20%, 19%, 18%, 17%, 16%, 15%, 14%, 13%, 12%, 11%, 10%, 9%, 8%, 7%, 6%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 1%, or less in either direction (greater than or less than) of the stated reference value unless otherwise stated or otherwise evident from the context (except where such number would exceed 100% of a possible value). [0093] Where a range of values is provided, it is understood that each intervening value, to the tenth of the unit of the lower limit unless the context clearly dictates otherwise, between the upper and lower limit of that range and any other stated or intervening value in that stated range is encompassed within the disclosure. The upper and lower limits of these smaller ranges may independently be included in the smaller ranges is also encompassed within the disclosure, subject to any specifically excluded limit in the stated range. Where the stated range includes one or both of the limits, ranges excluding either or both of those included limits are also included in the disclosure. [0094] “G,” “C,” “A,” “T” and “U” generally stand for the bases, guanine, cytosine, adenine, thymidine and uracil, respectively. Nucleobases can form nucleosides by the addition of a five carbon sugar. If the sugar is ribose then the nucleoside is a ribonucleoside. Nucleosides can in turn form nucleotides by the addition of one or more linker groups such as phosphate groups. Nucleotides can in turn form polymers (polynucleotides) which include short polymers (oligonucleotides). However, it will be understood that the terms “base”, “nucleobase”, “nucleoside”, “ribonucleoside”, “nucleotide”, “ribonucleotide” can also refer to a modified base, nucleobase, nucleoside, ribonucleoside, nucleotide, or ribonucleotide, as further detailed below, or a surrogate replacement moiety (see, e.g., Table 1B and elsewhere herein). The skilled person is well aware that guanine, cytosine, adenine, thymidine, uracil can be replaced by other moieties without substantially impairing one or more of certain properties (such as base pairing properties, translatability, or protein binding properties) of an oligonucleotide or polynucleotide comprising a nucleotide bearing such replacement moiety. Sequences containing such replacement moieties are suitable for the compositions and methods featured in the disclosure. Similarly, the skilled person is well aware that ribose can be replaced with other moieties without impairing certain properties (such as base pairing properties, translatability, or protein binding properties) of an oligonucleotide or polynucleotide comprising a nucleotide bearing such replacement moiety. Sequences containing such replacement moieties are suitable for the compositions and methods featured in the disclosure. Similarly, the skilled person is well aware that phosphate can be replaced with other moieties without impairing certain properties (such as base pairing properties, translatability, or protein binding properties) of an oligonucleotide or polynucleotide comprising a nucleotide bearing such replacement moiety. Sequences containing such replacement moieties are suitable for the compositions and methods featured in the disclosure. [0095] As used herein, the terms “polypeptide,” “peptide,” and “protein” refer to polymers of amino acids of any length. The terms also encompass an amino acid polymer that has been modified; for example, to include disulfide bond formation, glycosylation, lipidation, phosphorylation, or conjugation with a labeling component. [0096] As used herein, the terms “identity” and “identical” refer, with respect to a polypeptide or polynucleotide sequence-of-interest, to the percentage of exact matching residues in an alignment of that the sequence-of-interest to a reference sequence, such as an alignment generated by the BLAST algorithm. Identity is calculated, unless specified otherwise, across the full length of the reference sequence. Thus a sequence-of-interest “shares at least x% identity to” a reference sequence if, when the reference sequence is aligned (as a query sequence) is aligned to the sequence-of-interest (as subject sequence), at least x% (rounded down) of the residues in the subject sequence are aligned as an exact match to a corresponding residue in the query sequence, the denominator being the full length of the reference sequence plus the lengths of any gaps inserted into the reference sequence by alignment of the reference sequence to the sequence-of-interest. Where the subject sequence has variable positions (e.g., residues denoted X), an alignment to any residue in the query sequence is counted as a match. Sequence alignments may be performed using the NCBI Blast service (BLAST+ version 2.12.0) or another program giving the same results. [0097] The term “native” or “wild-type” as used herein refers to a nucleotide sequence, e.g. gene, or gene product, e.g. RNA or polypeptide, that is present in a wild-type cell, tissue, organ or organism. The term “variant” as used herein refers to a mutant of a reference polynucleotide or polypeptide sequence, for example a native polynucleotide or polypeptide sequence, i.e., having less than 100% sequence identity with the reference polynucleotide or polypeptide sequence. Put another way, a variant comprises at least one nucleotide difference (e.g., nucleotide substitution, nucleotide insertion, nucleotide deletion) or one amino acid difference (e.g., amino acid substitution, amino acid insertion, amino acid deletion) relative to a reference polynucleotide sequence, e.g. a native polynucleotide or polypeptide sequence. For example, a variant may be a polynucleotide having a sequence identity of 50% or more, 60% or more, or 70% or more with a full length native polynucleotide sequence, e.g. an identity of 75% or 80% or more, such as 85%, 90%, or 95% or more, for example, 98% or 99% identity with the full length native polynucleotide sequence. As another example, a variant may be a polypeptide having a sequence identity of 70% or more with a full length native polypeptide sequence, e.g. an identity of 75% or 80% or more, such as 85%, 90%, or 95% or more, for example, 98% or 99% identity with the full length native polypeptide sequence. Variants may also include variant fragments of a reference, e.g. native, sequence sharing a sequence identity of 70% or more with a fragment of the reference, e.g. native, sequence, e.g. an identity of 75% or 80% or more, such as 85%, 90%, or 95% or more, for example, 98% or 99% identity with the native sequence. [0098] As used herein, the term “codon optimized” refers to any process used to improve gene expression and increase the translational efficiency of a gene of interest by accommodating the codon bias of the host organism, and/or to reduce the immunogenicity of the polynucleotide. [0099] The terms “treating” or “treatment” are used herein to generally mean obtaining a desired pharmacologic and/or physiologic effect with a therapeutic agent. The effect may be prophylactic in terms of completely or partially preventing a disease or symptom thereof, e.g. reducing the likelihood that the disease or symptom thereof occurs in the subject, and/or may be therapeutic in terms of completely or partially reducing a symptom, or a partial or complete cure for a disease and/or adverse effect attributable to the disease. “Treatment” as used herein covers any treatment of a disease in a mammal, and includes: (a) preventing the disease from occurring in a subject which may be predisposed to the disease but has not yet been diagnosed as having it; (b) inhibiting or slowing the onset or development of the disease; or (c) relieving the disease, e.g., causing regression of the disease or symptoms associated with the disease. The therapeutic agent may be administered before, during or after the onset of disease. The treatment of ongoing disease, where the treatment stabilizes or reduces the undesirable clinical symptoms of the patient, may be of particular interest. In some embodiments, treatment is performed prior to complete loss of function in the affected tissues. In some embodiments, the subject therapy will be administered before the symptomatic stage of the disease; and, in some embodiments, during the symptomatic stage of the disease; and, in some embodiments, after the symptomatic stage of the disease. [0100] In some embodiments, therapies as described herein treat fibrotic diseases or liver diseases, including but not limited to fibrotic liver diseases. The fibrotic or liver diseases may be associated with a TERT mutation, mutation in other genes, or non-genetic causes. Diseases that may be treated using the composition and methods of the present disclosure include non- alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), e.g., stage F4 NASH, alcoholic hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, liver cirrhosis, e.g. compensated and non- compensated cirrhosis, liver fibrosis, hemochromatosis, biliary atresia, primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, chronic liver disease, acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF), Wilson’s disease, or ischemic hepatitis. [0101] The terms “individual,” “subject,” and “patient” are used interchangeably herein and refer to any subject for whom treatment or therapy is desired. The subject may be a mammalian subject. Mammalian subjects include, e. g., humans, non-human primates, rodents, (e.g., rats, mice), lagomorphs (e.g., rabbits), ungulates (e.g., cows, sheep, pigs, horses, goats, and the like), etc. In some embodiments, the subject is a human. In some embodiments, the subject is a non- human primate, for example a cynomolgus monkey. In some embodiments, the subject is a companion or service animal (e.g. cats or dogs). [0102] A subject “in need thereof,” as used herein, refers to any subject suffering from or identified to be at risk of developing a fibrotic disease or liver disease. [0103] It is to be understood that this disclosure is not limited to the particular methodology, products, apparatus and factors described, as such methods, apparatus and formulations may vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and it is not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure which will be limited only by appended claims. I. Synthetic mRNAs [0104] A synthetic mRNA as used herein may refer to any sequence comprising a mutation (point or deletion) or additional nucleotides not found in the wild type sequence. For example, a synthetic TERT mRNA may refer to a wild type sequence encoding a human TERT sequence, flanked by the addition of 1, 2, 3, 10, 100 or more nucleotides. Similarly, the nucleotides themselves may encode amino acids distinct from the wild type, or be modified to reduce immunogenicity in the cell or tissue.

TERT mRNAs [0105] In some embodiments, a composition may comprise a reverse transcriptase telomerase (TERT) mRNA sequence to treat one or more phenotypes or symptoms associated with a fibrotic disease or liver disease. In some embodiments, a TERT mRNA refers to an mRNA encoding any full length, functional fragment or portion of a TERT protein, including wild type sequences or variants thereof. [0106] In some embodiments, a TERT mRNA may comprise a codon-optimized sequence. In some embodiments, a TERT mRNA may comprise a uridine depleted human TERT sequence. In some embodiments, the codon-optimized sequence may comprise a sequence at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 97%, at least 99%, or 100% identical to SEQ ID NO 1: [0108] In some embodiments, a TERT mRNA may comprise a mutant human TERT sequence. In some embodiments, the mutant human TERT mRNA may encode a Y707F mutation in the resulting peptide sequence. In some embodiments a mutation in the TERT mRNA sequence encodes a mutation in the nuclear export signal which may result in nuclear retention of the TERT peptide. In some embodiments, the mutant TERT mRNA sequence may comprise a sequence at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 97%, at least 99%, or 100% identical to SEQ ID NO 2: [0110] In some embodiments, a mouse TERT mRNA may comprise a codon-optimized sequence. In some embodiments, a TERT mRNA may comprise a uridine depleted mouse TERT sequence. In some embodiments, the codon-optimized sequence may comprise a sequence at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 97%, at least 99%, or 100% identical to SEQ ID NO 3: [0112] In some embodiments, a mouse TERT mRNA may comprise a mutant mouse TERT sequence. In some embodiments, the mutant mouse TERT mRNA may encode a Y707F mutation in the resulting peptide sequence. In some embodiments a mutation in the TERT mRNA sequence encodes a mutation in the nuclear export signal which may result in nuclear retention of the TERT peptide. In some embodiments, the mutant mouse TERT mRNA sequence may comprise a sequence at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 97%, at least 99%, or 100% identical to SEQ ID NO 4: [0114] In some embodiments, a mouse TERT mRNA may comprise a mutant mouse TERT sequence. In some embodiments, the mutant mouse TERT mRNA may encode a Y697F mutation in the resulting peptide sequence. In some embodiments a mutation in the TERT mRNA sequence encodes a mutation in the nuclear export signal which may result in nuclear retention of the TERT peptide. In some embodiments, the mutant mouse TERT mRNA sequence may comprise a sequence at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 97%, at least 99%, or 100% identical to SEQ ID NO 5: [0116] The compositions comprise a ribonucleic acid, e.g., a synthetic ribonucleic acid coding for a telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), wherein telomeres are extended within a cell treated with the compound. The ribonucleic acids used in the transient expression of TERT can comprise a ribonucleic acid coding for a TERT protein. The ribonucleic acids can further comprise one or more sequences that affect the expression and/or stability of the ribonucleic acid in a cell. For example, the ribonucleic acids can contain a 5′ cap and untranslated region (UTR) to the 5′ and/or 3′ side of the coding sequence. The ribonucleic acids may further contain a 3′ tail, such as a poly-A tail. The poly-A tail can, for example, increase the stability of the ribonucleic acid. In some embodiments, the poly-A tail comprises at least 25 nucleotides, at least 50 nucleotides, at least 75 nucleotides, at least 100 nucleotides, at least 125 nucleotides, at least 150 nucleotides, at least 200 nucleotides, at least 225 nucleotides, at least250 nucleotides. In some embodiments, the poly-A tail comprises between 1 and 25 nucleotides, between 25 and 50 nucleotides, between 50 and 75 nucleotides, between 75 and 100 nucleotides, between 100 and 125 nucleotides, between 125 and 150 nucleotides, between 150 and 175 nucleotides, between 175 and 200 nucleotides, between 200 and 225 nucleotides, or between 225 and 250 nucleotides, inclusive of the endpoints for each range. In some embodiments, the poly-A tail comprises between 100 and 200 nucleotides, inclusive of the endpoints. [0117] In some embodiments, the 5′ cap of the ribonucleic acid is a non-immunogenic cap. In some embodiments, the 5′ cap may increase the translation of the ribonucleic acid. In some embodiments, the 5′ cap may be treated with phosphatase to modulate the innate immunogenicity of the ribonucleic acid. In some embodiments, the 5′ cap is an anti-reverse cap analog (“ARCA”), such as a 3′-O-Me-m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G RNA cap structure analog. In some embodiments, the 5’ cap is m7G(5’)ppp(5’)(2’OmeA)pG (also known as CleanCap© AG). In some embodiments, the 5’ cap is m7(3’OmeG)(5’)ppp(5’)(2’OmeA)pG (also known as CleanCap®AG (3’ Ome)). [0118] The above features, or others, may increase translation of the TERT protein encoded by the ribonucleic acid, may increase or decrease the stability of the ribonucleic acid itself in a cell type-specific or cell type-independent manner, or may do both. In some embodiments, the 5′ UTR and/or the 3′ UTR are from a gene that has a very stable mRNA and/or an mRNA that is rapidly translated, for example, α-globin or β-globin, c-fos, or tobacco etch virus. In some embodiments, the 5′ UTR and 3′ UTR are from different genes or are from different species than the species into which the compositions are being delivered. The UTRs may also be assemblies of parts of UTRs from the mRNAs of different genes, where the parts are selected to achieve a certain combination of stability and efficiency of translation. The UTRs may also comprise designed sequences that confer properties to the RNA such as cell type-specific stability or cell type-independent stability. [0119] The ribonucleic acids of the present disclosure may comprise one or more modified nucleosides, and/or comprise primary sequences of nucleosides, that modulate translation, stability, or immunogenicity of the RNA (“mRNA”). Most mature RNA molecules in eukaryotic cells contain nucleosides that are modified versions of the canonical unmodified RNA nucleosides, adenine, cytidine, guanosine, and uridine. For example, the 5’ cap of mature RNA comprises a modified nucleoside, and other modified nucleosides often occur elsewhere in the RNA. Those modifications may prevent the RNA from being recognized as a foreign RNA. Synthetic RNA molecules made using certain nucleosides are much less immunogenic than unmodified RNA. The immunogenicity can be reduced even further by purifying the synthetic mRNA, for example by using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The modified nucleosides may be, for example, chosen from the nucleosides listed below. The nucleosides are, in some embodiments, pseudouridine, 1-methylpseudouridine, 2-thiouridine, 5-methoxyuridine, or 5-methylcytidine. The primary sequence may be modified in ways that increase or decrease immunogenicity. Under some circumstances, it may be desirable for the modified RNA to retain some immunogenicity. [0120] Accordingly, in some embodiments, the ribonucleic acids of the instant compositions comprise a 1-methylpseudouridine, pseudouridine, a 5-methoxyuridine (5-moU), a 2- thiouridine, a 5-methylcytidine, or another modified nucleoside.

[0121] Without intending to be bound by theory, the presence of the modified nucleosides, and/or sequences of nucleosides that alter secondary structure of the RNA and/or binding of RNA to RNA binding proteins or microRNA, may enable mRNA to avoid activation of an immune response mediated by various receptors, including the Toll-like receptors and RIG-1. Non-immunogenic mRNA has been used as a therapeutic agent in mice via topical delivery. Kormann et al. (2011) Nature Biotechnology 29:154-157. In some embodiments, the ribonucleic acids comprise more than one of the above nucleosides or combination of the above nucleosides. In some embodiments, the ribonucleic acids comprise 1-methylpseudouridine, 5- methoxyuridine, or pseudouridine and 5-methylcytidine. [0122] In some embodiments, an immune response to the mRNA may be desired, and the RNA may be modified to induce an optimal level of innate immunity. In other embodiments, an immune response to the mRNA may not be desired, and the RNA may be modified in order to minimize such a reaction. The RNA can be modified for either situation. [0123] The ribonucleic acid molecules can be synthetic ribonucleic acids. The term “synthetic”, as used herein, can mean that the ribonucleic acids are in some embodiments prepared using the tools of molecular biology under the direction of a human, for example as described below. The synthetic ribonucleic acids may, for example, be prepared by in vitro synthesis using cellular extracts or purified enzymes and nucleic acid templates. The synthetic ribonucleic acids may in some embodiments be prepared by chemical synthesis, either partially or completely. Alternatively, or in addition, the synthetic ribonucleic acids may in some embodiments be prepared by engineered expression in a cell, followed by disruption of the cell and at least partial purification of the ribonucleic acid. [0124] The ribonucleic acids of the present disclosure may be prepared using a variety of techniques, as would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art. In some embodiments, the ribonucleic acids may be prepared by in vitro synthesis. In some embodiments, the ribonucleic acids may be prepared by chemical synthesis. In some embodiments, the ribonucleic acids may be prepared by a combination of in vitro synthesis and chemical synthesis. As described above, the term “synthetic” should be understood to include ribonucleic acids that are prepared either by chemical synthesis, by in vitro synthesis, by expression in vivo and at least partial purification, or by a combination of such, or other, chemical or molecular biological methods. [0125] The ribonucleic acids may, in some embodiments, be purified. As noted above, purification may reduce immunogenicity of the ribonucleic acids and may be advantageous in some circumstances. In some embodiments, the ribonucleic acids are purified by one or more of HPLC, DNAse treatment, protease treatment, or by affinity capture and elution. [0126] The protein structure of TERT can include at least three distinct domains: a long extension at the amino-terminus (the N-terminal extension, NTE) that contains conserved domains and an unstructured linker region; a catalytic reverse-transcriptase domain in the middle of the primary sequence that includes seven conserved reverse transcriptase (RT) motifs; and a short extension at the carboxyl-terminus. In some embodiments, the ribonucleic acid codes for a full-length TERT. In some embodiments, the ribonucleic acid codes for a catalytic reverse transcriptase domain of TERT. In some embodiments, the ribonucleic acid codes for a polypeptide having TERT activity. TERT activity may be measured using known methods including the telomerase repeat amplification protocol (TRAP). [0127] The TERT encoded by the ribonucleic acids of the instant disclosure may be a mammalian, avian, reptilian, or fish TERT. In some embodiments, the TERT is a mammalian TERT, such as human TERT. Meyerson et al. (1997) Cell 90:785-795; Nakamura et al. (1997) Science 277:955-959; Wick et al. (1999) Gene 232:97-106. [0128] The amino acid sequence of two human TERT isoforms are available as NCBI Reference Sequences: NP_937983.2 and NP_001180305.1. [0129] The amino acid sequence of human TERT isoform 1 may comprise or consist of the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6 (also described at GenBank Accession No. NP_937983.2): [0130] The nucleic acid sequence of human TERT isoform 1 may comprise or consist of the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 7 (also described at GenBank Accession No. NM_198253.3): [0131] The amino acid sequence of human TERT isoform 2 may comprise or consist of the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 8 (also described at GenBank Accession No. NP_001180305.1): [0132] The amino acid sequence of human TERT isoform 2 may comprise or consist of the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 9 (also described at GenBank Accession No. NM_001193376.3): [0133] In some embodiments, a human TERT mRNA may comprise a wild type TERT sequence. In some embodiments, the wild type TERT sequence may comprise a sequence at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 97%, at least 99%, or 100% identical to SEQ ID NO 30: [0135] In some embodiments, a mouse TERT mRNA may comprise a wild type TERT sequence. In some embodiments, the wild type TERT sequence may comprise a sequence at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 97%, at least 99%, or 100% identical to SEQ ID NO 31: [0137] In some embodiments, a TERT mRNA may comprise a nucleic acid sequence at least 50%, at least 55%, at least 60%, at least 65%, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99% or 100% identical to any one of SEQ ID NOS: 1-5, 7, 9 or 30. [0138] In some embodiments, a TERT mRNA may encode a modified TERT protein containing one or more amino acid substitutions, deletions, and/or insertions as compared to SEQ ID NOS: 6 or 8, while retaining substantial TERT activity. In some embodiments, a TERT mRNA may encode an amino acid sequence at least 50%, at least 55%, at least 60%, at least 65%, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99% or 100% identical to SEQ ID NO: 6 or SEQ ID NO: 8. [0139] In other embodiments, a TERT mRNA may encode an amino acid sequence with a mutation of L55Q, P65A, V70M, A202T, A279T, V299M, H412Y, a deletion of residue 441, R522K, K570N, R631Q, G682D, V694M, Y697F, P704S, Y707F, A716T, P721R, T726M, Y772C, P785L, V791I, R811C, L841F, R865H, V867M, R901W, K902N, P923L, S948R, R979W, V1025F, A1062T, V1090M, T1110M, and/or F1127L relative to the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NO: 6. In some embodiments, the TERT mRNA may encode a TERT isoform in which the translated protein lacks amino acid residues 711-722, 764-807, 808-1132, or 885-947 relative to the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NO: 6. In some embodiments about 1, about 5, about 10, about 20, or about 100 amino acids preceding or following the domain are also deleted from the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6.

[0162] The preparation of such base, nucleoside, nucleotide, and backbone analogues, modifications, and derivatives is known to a person skilled in the art e.g. from the U.S. Patent Nos. 4,373,071, U.S. Patent No. 4,401,796, U.S. Patent No. 4,415,732, U.S. Patent No. 4,458,066, U.S. Patent No.4,500,707, U.S. Patent No.4,668,777, U.S. Patent No.4,973,679, U.S. Patent No.5,047,524, U.S. Patent No.5,132,418, U.S. Patent No.5,153,319, U.S. Patent Nos.5,262,530 and 5,700,642, all of which are incorporated by reference in their entirety. [0163] In some embodiments, uracil nucleosides of the mRNA are about 80%, about 90%, 95%, 99%, or 100% depleted and replaced with a uracil nucleoside analog, e.g., pseudouridine, 5-methoxyuridine, or N-1-methyl-pseudouridine. [0164] In some embodiments, an mRNA may contain an RNA backbone modification. Typically, a backbone modification is a modification in which the phosphates of the backbone of the nucleotides contained in the RNA are chemically modified. Exemplary backbone modifications may include, but are not limited to, modifications in which the phosphodiester linkage is replaced with a member from the group consisting of peptides, methylphosphonates, methylphosphoramidates, phosphoramidates, phosphorothioates (e.g., cytidine 5’-0-(l- thiophosphate)), boranophosphates, and/or positively charged guanidimum groups, or other means of replacing the phosphodiester linkage. [0165] In some embodiments, an mRNA may contain sugar modifications. A sugar modification may include but is not limited to, 2′ O-methyl sugar modifications, 2′ fluoro sugar modifications (e.g.2’-fluororibose), 3’ amino sugar modifications, 2’ thio sugar modifications, 2’-O-alkyl sugar modifications, 5-methylthioribose, and sugar modifications of 2’-deoxy-2’- fluoro-ribonucleotide (2’-fluoro-2’-deoxycytidine, 2’-fluoro-2’-deoxyuridine), 2’-deoxy-2’- deamine-ribonucleotide (2’-amino-2’-deoxycytidine, 2,-amino-2’-deoxyuridine), 2’-O- alkylribonucleotide, 2’-deoxy-2’-C-alkylribonucleotide (2’-O-methylcytidine, 2’- methyluridine), 2’-C-alkylribonucleotide, and isomers thereof (2’-aracytidine, 2’-arauridine), or azidophosphates (2’-azido-2’-deoxycytidine, 2’-azido-2’-deoxyuridine). [0166] In some embodiments, an mRNA may be synthesized from one or more of the nucleotide triphosphates comprising any of the nucleosides and nucleotides disclosed herein, or any of the following nucleoside triphosphates: 2’-Deoxyadenosine-5’-O-(1- Thiotriphosphate), 2’-Deoxycytidine-5’-O-(1-Thiotriphosphate), 2’-Deoxyguanosine-5’-O-(1- Thiotriphosphate), 2’-Deoxythymidine-5’-O-(1-Thiotriphosphate), Adenosine-5’-O-(1- Thiotriphosphate), Cytidine-5’-O-(1-Thiotriphosphate), Guanosine-5’-O-(1- Thiotriphosphate), Uridine-5’-O-(1-Thiotriphosphate), 2’,3’-Dideoxyadenosine-5’-O-(1- Thiotriphosphate), 2’,3’-Dideoxycytidine-5’-O-(1-Thiotriphosphate), 2’,3’- Dideoxyguanosine-5’-O-(1-Thiotriphosphate), 3’-Deoxythymidine-5’-O-(1- Thiotriphosphate), 3’-Azido-2’,3’-dideoxythymidine-5’-O-(1-Thiotriphosphate), 2’,3’- Dideoxyuridine-5’-O-(1-Thiotriphosphate), 2’-Deoxyadenosine-5’-O-(1- Boranotriphosphate), 2’-Deoxycytidine-5’-O-(1-Boranotriphosphate), 2’-Deoxyguanosine-5’- O-(1-Boranotriphosphate), and 2’-Deoxythymidine-5’-O-(1-Boranotriphosphate). [0167] In some embodiments, an mRNA may include the addition of a “cap” on the N-terminal (5’) end, and a “tail” on the C-terminal (3’) end. The presence of the cap may provide resistance to nucleases found in eukaryotic cells. The presence of a “tail” may protect the mRNA from exonuclease degradation. Cap structure [0168] In some embodiments, an mRNA may include a 5’ cap structure. A 5’ cap may comprise for example, a triphosphate linkage and a guanine nucleotide in which the 7-nitrogen is methylated. Examples of cap structures include, but are not limited to, m7G(5’)ppp (5’)A, G(5’)ppp(5’)A, and G(5’)ppp(5’)G. Naturally occurring cap structures comprise a 7-methyl guanosine that is linked via a triphosphate bridge to the 5’-end of the first transcribed nucleotide, resulting in a dinucleotide cap of m7G(5’)ppp(5’)N, where N is any nucleoside. In vivo, the cap is added in the nucleus by the enzyme guanylyl transferase immediately after initiation of transcription. [0169] In some embodiments, a 5’cap may comprise an m7(3’OmeG)(5’)ppp(5’)(2’OmeA)pG or (CleanCap TM 3’ Ome) structure. In some embodiments, a 5’ cap may comprise a m7G(5’)ppp(5’)G. In some embodiments, the Anti-Reverse Cap Analog (“ARCA”) or modified ARCA, is a 5’ cap in which the 2’ or 3’ OH group is replaced with -OCH3. In some embodiments, the ARCA comprises an 3′-O-Me-m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G structure. In some embodiments, the 5’ cap comprises m7G(5’)ppp(5’)(2’OmeA)pG. Additional mRNA caps may include, but are not limited to, a chemical structures selected from the group consisting of m7GpppG, m7GpppA, m7GpppC; unmethylated caps (e.g., GpppG); a 71emethylated cap (e.g., m2’7GpppG), a trimethylated cap analog, or anti reverse cap analogs (e.g., ARCA; m7,2’0meGpppG, m72’dGpppG, m7’3’0meGpppG, m7,3 dGpppG and their tetraphosphate derivatives) (see, e.g., Jemielity, J. et al, ‘Wove anti-reverse cap analogs with superior translational properties”, RNA, 9: 1108-1122 (2003)). [0170] In some embodiments, a suitable cap is a 7-methyl guanylate (“m7G”) linked via a triphosphate bridge to the 5 ‘-end of the first transcribed nucleotide, resulting in m7G(5’)ppp(5’)N, where N is any nucleoside. A embodiment of a m7G cap utilized in embodiments of the disclosure is m7G(5’)ppp(5’)G. In some embodiments, the cap is a Cap0 structure. Cap0 structures lack a 2’-0- methyl residue of the ribose attached to bases 1 and 2. In some embodiments, the cap is a Capl structure. Capl structures have a 2’-0-methyl residue at base 2. In some embodiments, the cap is a Cap2 structure. Cap2 structures have a 2’-0-methyl residue attached to both bases 2 and 3. [0171] A variety of m7G cap analogs are known in the art, many of which are commercially available. These include the m7 GpppG described above, as well as the ARCA 3’- OCH3 and 2’-OCH3 cap analogs (Jemielity, J. et al., RNA, 9: 1108-1122 (2003)). Additional cap analogs for use in embodiments of the disclosure include N7-benzylated dinucleoside tetraphosphate analogs (described in Grudzien, E. et at, RNA, 10: 1479-1487 (2004)), phosphorothioate cap analogs (described in Grudzien-Nogalska, E., et al, RNA, 13: 1745-1755 (2007)), and cap analogs (including biotinylated cap analogs) described in U.S. Patent Nos. 8,093,367 and 8,304,529, incorporated by reference herein. [0172] In some embodiments, the 5’ cap is inosine, Nl-methyl-guanosine, 2’fluoro-guanosine, 7-deaza-guanosine, m7(3’OmeG)(5’)ppp(5’)(2’OmeA)pG, CleanCap TM , m7(3’OmeG)(5’)ppp(5’)(2’OmeA)pG, 8-oxo-guanosine, 2-amino-guanosine, LNA- guanosine, 2-azido-guanosine, Cap2, Cap4, CAP-003, or CAP-225. [0173] In some embodiments, the 5’ cap comprises or consists of an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). In some embodiments the IRES is within the 5’ UTR. In some embodiments, the 5’ cap comprises or consists of a 2A self-cleavage peptide, e.g, one or more of P2A, T2A, E2A and F2A. Tail structure [0174] The presence of a “tail” may serve to protect an mRNA from exonuclease degradation. The poly-A tail is thought to stabilize natural messengers and synthetic sense RNA. Therefore, in certain embodiments a long poly-A tail can be added to an mRNA molecule thus rendering the RNA more stable. Poly-A tails can be added using a variety of art-recognized techniques. For example, long poly-A tails can be added to synthetic or in vitro transcribed RNA using poly-A polymerase (Yokoe, et al. Nature Biotechnology.1996; 14: 1252-1256). A transcription vector can also encode long poly-A tails. In addition, poly-A tails can be added by transcription directly from PCR products. Poly-A may also be ligated to the 3’ end of a sense RNA with RNA ligase (see, e.g., Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual, 2 nd Ed., ed. By Sambrook, Fritsch and Maniatis (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press: 1991 edition)). [0175] In some embodiments, an mRNA may include a 3’ poly(A) tail structure. The length of the poly-A tail may be at least about 10, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400 or at least about 500 nucleotides. In some embodiments, a poly-A tail on the 3’ terminus of an mRNA may include about 10 to 300 adenosine nucleotides (e.g., about 10 to 200 adenosine nucleotides, about 10 to 150 adenosine nucleotides, about 10 to 100 adenosine nucleotides, about 20 to 70 adenosine nucleotides, or about 20 to 60 adenosine nucleotides). In some embodiments, the poly A tail is 120 adenosine nucleotides. In some embodiments, an mRNA may include a 3’ polyI tail structure. A poly-C tail on th’ 3' terminus of mRNA may include about 10 to 200 cytosine nucleotides (e.g., about 10 to 150 cytosine nucleotides, about 10 to 100 cytosine nucleotides, about 20 to 70 cytosine nucleotides, about 20 to 60 cytosine nucleotides, or about 10 to 40 cytosine nucleotides). The poly-C tail may be added to the poly-A tail or may substitute the poly-A tail. In some embodiments, the length of the poly-A or poly C tail is associated with the stability of a modified sense mRNA and, therefore, the transcription of the protein. For example, because the length of the poly-A tail may influence the half-life of a sense mRNA molecule, the length of the poly-A tail may be adjusted to modify the level of resistance of the mRNA to nucleases, thereby providing more control over the time course of polynucleotide expression and/or polypeptide production.’ 5' an’ 3' Untranslated Regions (UTRs) [0176] In some embodiments, an mRNA may include 5' untranslated region (UTR) and/or a 3’ UTR. In some embodiments, a 5' UTR may include one or more elements that affect the stability or translation of an mRNA. In some embodiments, the 5’UTR for example, may include an iron responsive element. In some embodiments, 5' UTR may be between about 50 to about 100, or from about 50 to about 500 nucleotides in length. In some embodiments, 3' UTR includes one or more of a poly-A signal, a binding site for proteins that may affect mRNA stability or localization, or one or more binding sites for miRNAs. In some embodiments, 3' UTR may be between about 0 and about 50 nucleotides, or about 50 to about 100 nucleotides in length. [0177] Example 3' an’ 5' UTR sequences may be derived from mRNAs with relatively long half-lives (e.g., globin, actin, GAPDH, tubulin, histone, or citric acid cycle enzymes) to increase the stability of the sense mRNA molecule. For example, 5' UTR sequence may include a partial sequence of a cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate-early 1 (IE1) gene, or a fragment thereof to improve the nuclease resistance and/or improve the half-life of the polynucleotide. Generally, these modifications improve the stability and/or pharmacokinetic properties (e.g., half-life) of the polynucleotide relative to their unmodified counterparts, and include, for example modifications made to improve such polynucleoti’es' resistance to in vivo nuclease digestion. [0178] In some embodiments, a UTR may improve tissue specific expression, e.g., in the liver. [0179] In some embodiments, the 3’ UTR is a mouse alpha-globin 3’ UTR. In some embodiments, the 3’ UTR comprises a sequence at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 97%, at least 99%, or 100% identical to SEQ ID NO: 32 [0180] In some embodiments, the 3’ UTR is a wild type human beta-globin 3’ UTR. In some embodiments, the 3’ UTR comprises a sequence at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 97%, at least 99%, or 100% identical to SEQ ID NO: 33 [0181] In some embodiments, the 3’ UTR is a variant human beta-globin 3’ UTR. In some embodiments, the 3’ UTR comprises a sequence at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 97%, at least 99%, or 100% identical to SEQ ID NO: 34 [0182] In some embodiments, the 5’ UTR is a synthetic 5’ UTR. In some embodiments, the 5’ UTR comprises a sequence at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 97%, at least 99%, or 100% identical to SEQ ID NO: 35 [0183] In some embodiments, the 5’ UTR is a human beta-globin 5’ UTR. In some embodiments, the 5’ UTR comprises a sequence at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 97%, at least 99%, or 100% identical to SEQ ID NO: 36 [0184] In some embodiments, the UTR may be any of, or functional variants of, those described in any of PCT Application No. WO2017053297A1 and Patent No. US10519189B2, both of which are incorporated herein in their entirety.

[0289] The nucleic acid can be introduced into the cell in vivo and / or in vitro by encapsulating the nucleic acid in the lipid membrane structure containing the ionizable lipid of the present disclosure and bringing it into contact with the cell. Therefore, the present disclosure provides a nucleic acid introduction agent comprising the ionizable lipid or lipid membrane structure of the present disclosure. [0290] The nucleic acid introduction agent of the present disclosure can introduce any nucleic acid into cells. Examples of the nucleic acid include, but are not limited to, DNA, RNA, RNA chimeric nucleic acid, DNA / RNA hybrid, and the like. The nucleic acid can be any one of 1 to 3 strands, but is optionally single strand or double strand. Nucleic acids may be other types of nucleotides that are N-glycosides of purine or pyrimidine bases, or other oligomers having a non-nucleotide backbone (e.g., commercially available peptide nucleic acids (PNA), etc.) or other oligomers with special linkages. The oligomer may contain nucleotides having a configuration that allows base pairing or base attachment as found in DNA or RNA. In addition, the nucleic acid may be substituted with, for example, a known modified nucleic acid, a labeled nucleic acid, a capped nucleic acid, a methylated nucleic acid, or one or more natural nucleotides known in the art, intramolecular nucleotide modified nucleic acids, nucleic acids with uncharged bonds (e.g., methyl sulfonate, phosphotriester, phosphoramidate, carbamate, etc.), charged bonds or sulfur containing bonds (eg phosphorothioate), side chain groups such as proteins (e.g., nucleases, nuclease inhibitors, toxins, antibodies, signal peptides, poly-L- lysine, etc.) and sugars (eg, monosaccharides), nucleic acids and nucleic acids with intercurrent compounds (eg, acridine, psoralen, etc.), nucleic acids containing chelate compounds (eg, metals, radioactive metals, boron, oxidizing metals, etc.), nucleic acids containing alkylating agents, and nucleic acids with modified bonds (eg, alpha anomeric nucleic acids, etc.) [0291] The type of DNA that can be used in the present disclosure is not particularly limited, and can be appropriately selected depending on the purpose of use. Examples include plasmid DNA, cDNA, antisense DNA, chromosomal DNA, PAC, BAC, and CpG oligo, optionally plasmid DNA, cDNA, and antisense DNA, or plasmid DNA. Circular DNA such as plasmid DNA can be appropriately digested with a restriction enzyme or the like and used as linear DNA. [0292] The type of RNA that can be used in the present disclosure is not particularly limited, and can be appropriately selected depending on the purpose of use. For example, siRNA, miRNA, shRNA, antisense RNA, messenger RNA (mRNA), single-stranded RNA genome, double-stranded RNA genome, RNA replicon, transfer RNA, ribosomal RNA, etc., optionally siRNA, miRNA, shRNA, mRNA, antisense RNA, RNA replicon. [0293] The nucleic acid used in the present disclosure is optionally purified by a method commonly used by those skilled in the art. [0294] The nucleic acid-introducing agent of the present disclosure encapsulating nucleic acid can be administered in vivo for the purpose of, for example, prevention and / or treatment of diseases. Accordingly, the nucleic acid used in the present disclosure is optionally a nucleic acid having preventive and / or therapeutic activity against a given disease (prophylactic / therapeutic nucleic acid). Examples of such nucleic acids include nucleic acids used for so- called gene therapy. [0295] In order to introduce a nucleic acid into a cell using the nucleic acid introduction agent of the present disclosure, the nucleic acid was encapsulated by coexisting the target nucleic acid when forming the lipid membrane structure of the present disclosure. The lipid membrane structure of the present disclosure is formed. For example, when liposomes are formed by the ethanol dilution method, the aqueous solution of nucleic acid and the ethanol solution of the components of the lipid membrane structure of the present disclosure (lipids, etc.) are vigorously mixed by vortex or microchannel, etc. Is diluted with an appropriate buffer. When liposomes are formed by the simple hydration method, the components (lipids, etc.) of the lipid membrane structure of the present disclosure are dissolved in an appropriate organic solvent, the solution is placed in a glass container, and the solvent is retained by drying under reduced pressure and left to obtain a lipid film. Here, an aqueous solution of nucleic acid is added and hydrated, followed by sonication with a sonicator. The present disclosure also provides the above lipid membrane structure in which such a nucleic acid is encapsulated. [0296] An example of a lipid membrane structure in which a nucleic acid is encapsulated is LNP encapsulated in a nucleic acid by forming an electrostatic complex between the nucleic acid and a ionizable lipid. This LNP can be used as a drug delivery system for selectively delivering a nucleic acid or the like into a specific cell. For example, a DNA vaccine by introducing an antigen gene into a dendritic cell, a gene therapy drug for a tumor, RNA It is useful for nucleic acid drugs that suppress the expression of target genes using interference. [0297] The particle diameter of the lipid membrane structure of the present disclosure encapsulating nucleic acid is not particularly limited, but is optionally 10 nm to 500 nm, or 30 nm to 300 nm. The particle diameter can be measured using a particle size distribution measuring apparatus such as Zetasizer Nano (Malvern). The particle diameter of the lipid membrane structure can be appropriately adjusted according to the method for preparing the lipid membrane structure. [0298] The surface potential (zeta potential) of the lipid membrane structure of the present disclosure encapsulating nucleic acid is not particularly limited, but may be −60 to +60 mV, −45 to 45 mV, −30 to +30 mV, −15 to +15 mV, or −10 to +10 mV. In conventional gene transfer, particles having a positive surface potential have been mainly used. While this is useful as a method to promote electrostatic interaction with negatively charged cell surface heparin sulfate and promote cellular uptake, positive surface charge is delivered intracellularly. There is a possibility that the nucleic acid release from the carrier due to the interaction with the nucleic acid is suppressed, and the protein synthesis due to the interaction between the mRNA and the delivery nucleic acid is suppressed. By adjusting the surface charge within the above range, this problem can be solved. The surface charge can be measured by using a zeta potential measuring device such as Zetasizer Nano. The surface charge of the lipid membrane structure can be adjusted by the composition of the components of the lipid membrane structure containing the ionizable lipid of the present disclosure. [0299] The lipid membrane surface pKa (hereinafter referred to as Liposomal pKa) of the lipid membrane structure of the present disclosure is not particularly limited, but may have a pKa of 5.5 to 7.2, or a pKa of 6.0. to 6.8. Liposomal pKa is used as an index indicating that the lipid membrane structure taken up by endocytosis is susceptible to protonation of the lipid membrane structure in a weakly acidic environment within the endosome. Liposomal pKa can be adjusted by the composition of the components of the lipid membrane structure containing the ionizable lipid of any of the above embodiments. [0300] The hemolysis activity (membrane fusion ability) of a lipid membrane structure of the present disclosure is not particularly limited, but may have no hemolysis activity (less than 5%) at physiological pH (pH 7.4), and may be endosomal. The higher the hemolysis activity, the more efficiently the nucleic acid can be delivered into the cytoplasm. However, if the hemolysis activity is present at physiological pH, the nucleic acid will be delivered to unintended cells during residence in the blood, resulting in decreased target-directedness and toxicity. Therefore, it is preferable to have hemolysis activity only in the endosomal environment as described above. The hemolysis activity can be adjusted by the composition of the components of the lipid membrane structure containing the ionizable lipid of the present disclosure. [0301] By bringing the lipid membrane structure of the present disclosure in which nucleic acid is encapsulated into contact with the cell, the encapsulated nucleic acid can be introduced into the cell. The cell may be a cultured cell line containing cancer cells, a cell isolated from an individual or tissue, or a tissue or tissue piece of cell. Further, the cells may be adherent cells or non-adherent cells. [0302] The step of bringing the lipid membrane structure of the present disclosure encapsulating nucleic acid into contact with cells in vitro will be specifically described below. [0303] Cells are suspended in an appropriate medium several days before contact with the lipid membrane structure and cultured under appropriate conditions. Upon contact with the lipid membrane structure, the cell may or may not be in the growth phase. [0304] The culture medium at the time of the contact may be a serum-containing medium or a serum-free medium, but the serum concentration in the medium may be 30% by weight or less, more may be 20% by weight or less. If the medium contains excessive protein such as serum, the contact between the lipid membrane structure and the cell may be inhibited. [0305] The cell density at the time of the contact is not particularly limited and can be appropriately set in consideration of the cell type, but is usually in the range of 1 × 10 4 to 1 × 10 7 cells/mL. [0306] For example, a suspension of the lipid membrane structure of the present disclosure in which the above-described nucleic acid is encapsulated is added to the cells thus prepared. The addition amount of the suspension is not particularly limited, and can be appropriately set in consideration of the number of cells and the like. The concentration of the lipid membrane structure at the time of contacting the cell is not particularly limited as long as the introduction of the target nucleic acid into the cell can be achieved, but the lipid concentration is usually 1 to 100 nmol / mL, and may be 0.1 to 10 μg / mL. [0307] After adding the above suspension to the cells, the cells are cultured. The culture temperature, humidity, CO 2 concentration, etc. are appropriately set in consideration of the cell type. When the cells are mammalian cells, the temperature is usually about 37 ° C., the humidity is about 95%, and the CO 2 concentration is about 5%. In addition, the culture time can be appropriately set in consideration of conditions such as the type of cells used, but may be in the range of 0.1 to 76 hours, or in the range of 0.2 to 24 hours, and may be 0..5-12 hours. If the culture time is too short, the nucleic acid is not sufficiently introduced into the cells, and if the culture time is too long, the cells may be weakened. [0308] The nucleic acid is introduced into the cells by the above-described culture. The medium may be replaced with a fresh medium, or the fresh medium is added to the medium and the cultivation is further continued. If the cells are mammalian cells, the fresh medium may contain serum or nutrient factors. [0309] The lipid membrane structure of the present disclosure may further contain other components in addition to the ionizable lipid of the present disclosure. Examples of the other components include lipids (phospholipids (such as phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine), glycolipids, peptide lipids, cholesterol, ionizable lipids other than cationic lipids, PEG lipids, etc.), surfactants (eg 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio] propane sulfonate, cholic acid sodium salt, octyl glycoside, ND-gluco -N-methylalkanamides), polyethylene glycol, proteins and the like. [0310] The lipid membrane structure of the present disclosure is prepared by dispersing the ionizable lipid of the present disclosure and other components (lipids, etc.) in a suitable solvent or dispersion medium, for example, an aqueous solvent or an alcoholic solvent, and if necessary, tissue. It can be prepared by performing an operation that induces crystallization. [0311] Examples of the “operation for inducing organization” include an ethanol dilution method using a microchannel or a vortex, a simple hydration method, an ultrasonic treatment, a heating, a vortex, an ether injection method, a French press method, and a cholic acid method. Examples thereof include, but are not limited to, methods known per se such as Ca 2+ fusion method, freeze-thaw method, and reverse phase evaporation method. [0312] The nucleic acid can be introduced into the cell in vivo and / or in vitro by encapsulating the nucleic acid in the lipid membrane structure containing the ionizable lipid of the present disclosure and bringing it into contact with the cell. Therefore, the present disclosure provides a nucleic acid introduction agent comprising the ionizable lipid or lipid membrane structure of the present disclosure. [0313] The nucleic acid introduction agent of the present disclosure can introduce any nucleic acid into cells. Examples of the nucleic acid include, but are not limited to, DNA, RNA, RNA chimeric nucleic acid, DNA / RNA hybrid, and the like. The nucleic acid can be any one of 1 to 3 strands, but may be single strand or double strand. Nucleic acids may be other types of nucleotides that are N-glycosides of purine or pyrimidine bases, or other oligomers having a non-nucleotide backbone (eg, commercially available peptide nucleic acids (PNA), etc.) or other oligomers with special linkages. The oligomer may contain nucleotides having a configuration that allows base pairing or base attachment as found in DNA or RNA. [0314] The type of RNA that can be used in the present disclosure is not particularly limited, and can be appropriately selected depending on the purpose of use. For example, siRNA, miRNA, shRNA, antisense RNA, messenger RNA (mRNA), single-stranded RNA genome, double-stranded RNA genome, RNA replicon, transfer RNA, ribosomal RNA, etc., or siRNA, miRNA, shRNA, mRNA, antisense RNA, or an RNA replicon. [0315] The nucleic acid used in the present disclosure may be purified by a method commonly used by those skilled in the art. [0316] The nucleic acid-introducing agent of the present disclosure encapsulating nucleic acid can be administered in vivo for the purpose of, for example, prevention and / or treatment of diseases. Accordingly, the nucleic acid used in the present disclosure may be a nucleic acid having preventive andat/or therapeutic activity against a given disease (prophylactic / therapeutic nucleic acid). Examples of such nucleic acids include nucleic acids used for so- called gene therapy. IV.

VI. Methods of Extending Telomeres [0332] In another aspect, the instant disclosure provides methods of extending telomeres, comprising the step of administering any of the above-described compounds or compositions to a cell with shortened telomeres, wherein telomeres are extended within the cell. The instant disclosure also provides methods of treatment, comprising the step of administering any of the above-described compounds or compositions to an animal subject in need of, or that may benefit from, telomere extension. [0333] In some embodiments, the compounds or compositions are administered to a cell, wherein the cell is an isolated cell or is part of a cell culture, an isolated tissue culture, an isolated organ, or the like (i.e., the administration is in vitro). [0334] In other embodiments, the compounds or compositions are administered without isolating the cell or cells, the tissue, or the organ from the subject (i.e., the administration is in vivo). In some of these embodiments, the compound or composition is delivered to all, or almost all, cells in the subject’s body. In some embodiments, the compound or composition is delivered to a specific cell, cell type, tissue, or organ in the subject’s body. [0335] Administration of the compounds or compositions of the instant disclosure may result in the transient expression of a telomerase activity in the cell. The increased activity may be measured by various assays, such as, for example, the telomerase repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) assay. Commercial versions of the TRAP assay are available, for example the Trapeze® telomerase detection kit (Millipore), which provides a sensitive detection and quantitation of telomerase activity, although other measurement techniques are also possible. [0336] As previously noted, one of the advantages of the instant techniques is that the expression of telomerase activity is transient in the treated cells. In particular, such transient expression is in contrast to previous techniques where a telomerase reverse transcriptase gene persists in an episomal DNA moiety, or is inserted into the genomic sequence of the cell or otherwise permanently modifies the genetic make-up of the targeted cell and results in constitutive activity of the nucleic acid sequence. [0337] FIG.1 graphically illustrates some of the advantages of the compounds, compositions, and methods disclosed herein. In particular, the speed of telomere extension made possible with these compounds, compositions, and methods enables telomere maintenance by very infrequent delivery of TERT mRNA. The expressed telomerase activity rapidly extends telomeres in a brief period, before being turned over, thus allowing the protective anti-cancer mechanism of telomere-shortening to function most of the time. Between treatments, normal telomerase activity and telomere shortening is present, and therefore the anti-cancer safety mechanism of telomere shortening to prevent out-of-control proliferation remains intact, while the risk of short telomere-related disease remains low. In contrast, small molecule treatments for extending telomeres may require chronic delivery, and thus present a chronic cancer risk, with minimal therapeutic benefit. [0338] In some embodiments of the instant methods, the transient expression is independent of cell cycle. [0339] As noted above, the transient expression of telomerase reverse transcriptase results in the extension of shortened telomeres in treated cells. Telomere length can be measured using techniques such as terminal restriction fragment (TRF) length analysis, qPCR, MMqPCR, TeSLA, flow FISH, and Q-FISH, as would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art. In some embodiments, the instant methods increase average telomere length in treated cells by at least 0.1 kb, at least 0.2 kb, at least 0.3 kb, at least 0.4 kb, at least 0.5 kb, at least 1 kb, at least 2 kb, at least 3 kb, at least 4 kb, at least 5 kb, or even more. In some embodiments, the instant methods reduce the percentage of telomeres with lengths below a certain length, for example 1 kb, 2 kb, 3 kb, 4 kb, 5 kb, or more. [0340] One of the advantages of the instant compounds, compositions, and methods, is the rapidity of extension of telomeres achieved by these techniques. The techniques allow treatments to be brief, and thus the interval between treatments can be long, and thus the treatments can be safe because the normal protective telomere shortening mechanism remains intact for most of the time i.e. between treatments. [0341] The transient expression of telomerase reverse transcriptase also results in an increased replicative capacity in treated cells. Increased replicative capacity is readily monitored in cells that are approaching replicative senescence by measuring additional population doublings in such cells. Senescent cells do not divide in response to many conditions that cause normal cells to divide, for example passage in culture or treatment with serum. Senescent cells are further often characterized by the expression of pH-dependent β-galactosidase activity, expression of cell cycle inhibitors p53 and p19, and other altered patterns of gene expression, and an enlarged cell size. It is known in the art that, absent treatment with TERT mRNA, certain types of cells (e.g., human lung fibroblast cells) typically double 50-60 times after birth before senescing; with TERT mRNA treatments, however, these cells achieve an additional 16-28 population doublings. If treated again several weeks later, additional proliferative capacity is conferred again. This process of intermittent treatments to periodically re-extend telomeres may be applied additional times, with the interval between treatments depending on factors such as the rate of telomere shortening, the rate of cell divisions, and the amount of telomere extension provided by the treatment. Likewise, human microvascular dermal endothelial cells from an aged individual, absent treatment with the instant compositions, may achieve only 1-2 population doublings, whereas treated cells may achieve 3, 4, or even more population doublings. [0342] Accordingly, in some embodiments, the instant treatment methods increase the number of population doublings of treated cells. VII. Therapeutic kits [0343] Therapeutic kits comprising a pharmaceutical composition of a TERT mRNA, or sequences thereof (including complementary sequences), and instructions for use are also contemplated herein. In some embodiments, the therapeutic kit comprises devices for administration, including but not limited to syringes, inhalers, nebulizers, and vials or containers.

EXAMPLES [0464] The following examples are included for illustrative purposes and are not intended to limit the scope of the disclosure. Example 1: LNP Formulations for mRNA Expression in Liver [0465] This Example demonstrates that three diverse lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulations may be used to deliver an mRNA encoding a heterologous protein to the liver of a subject animal. An LNP formulation that includes an SS-OP lipid resulted in the highest levels of expression and/or activity of the heterologous protein. In this Example, intravenous administration was used. Furthermore, the SS-OP-based formulation (LNP1) caused less tissue toxicity than a cKK-E12-based formulation (LNP2). These experiments demonstrate expression of the report Luciferase or the therapeutic gene TERT in the liver of subject animals. In particular, an SS-OP-based formulation is here shown to cause high TERT expression and/or activity with low toxicity. [0466] Table 5 shows illustrative lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulations targeting the liver in total lipid/mRNA ratios by weight/weight (wt/wt). Table 5 [0467] Compositions and methods of the disclosure may be used for the treatment of cirrhosis. In some embodiments, compositions and/or methods of use of compositions of the disclosure intended for treatment of cirrhosis induce TERT expression or increase TERT activity in a liver cell. In some embodiments, compositions and/or methods of use of compositions of the disclosure intended for treatment of cirrhosis do not induce cellular, tissue or systemic toxicity. Compositions may be administered systemically, e.g, intravenously. [0468] FIG. 2 is a series of graphs showing that mRNA LNPs exhibit low toxicity by liver panel. Mice were dosed intravenously with GRP or CRE mRNA encapsulated in a lipid nanoparticle employing either LNP1(comprising SS-OP TM ) or LNP2 (comprising cKK-E12) (N=1-4 per condition). Mice were sacrificed and blood was collected at the time points indicated (12, 24, and 72 hours). Mice receiving saline (N=4) and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4, N=4) served as negative and positive controls, respectively. Error bars display standard error of the mean. [0469] FIG. 3 is a series of photographs showing that intravenous delivery of TERT mRNA LNPs does not result in anormal histology.11 µg Cre mRNA was encapsulated into LNP1 and delivered intravenously into tdTomato fl/fl mice. Organs were harvested 72 hours later, fixed, paraffin embedded, and sectioned. Organs from an untreated tdTomato fl/fl mouse are shown for reference. [0470] FIG. 4 is a series of photographs showing that TERT mRNA LNPs transfect hepatocytes with high efficiency.11 µg Cre mRNA was encapsulated into LNP 1 and delivered intravenously (i.v.) into tdTomato fl/fl mice. Organs were harvested 72 hours later, fixed, paraffin embedded, and sectioned. Photographs depict immunohistochemistry (IHC) with anti- tdTomato. Organs from an untreated tdTomato fl/fl mouse are shown for reference. [0471] FIG. 5 is a series of photographs showing that TERT mRNA LNPs also target some cells in spleen, particularly in the red pulp area.11 µg Cre mRNA was encapsulated into LNP1 and delivered intravenously (i.v.) into tdTomato fl/fl mice. Organs were harvested 72 hours later, fixed, paraffin embedded, and sectioned. Photographs depict immunohistochemistry (IHC) with anti-tdTomato. Organs from an untreated tdTomato fl/fl mouse are shown for reference. [0472] FIG. 6 is a pair of graphs showing that TERT mRNA LNPs cause high telomerase activity in liver. Tert mRNA (SEQ ID NO: 37) was formulated with LNP1 or LNP2 and delivered intravenously in a concentration of 0.6 mg/kg into TERT KO mice. 20 hours later, the livers were harvested for TRAP. Wild-type C57Bl6/J and untreated TERT KO mouse livers were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. [0473] The TRAP assay uses lysate from cells or tissues incubated with an artificial telomere (DNA oligonucleotide) to detect telomerase. If active telomerase is present, it extends the artificial telomere 6 base pairs (bp) at a time, producing a ladder pattern. This extension reaction is amplified by PCR and run on a gel (in this case Agilent bioanalyzer, a microfluidic agarose gel). The presence of a ladder in 6 bp increments indicates telomerase activity. [0474] FIG. 7 is a photograph demonstrating that exemplary LNP formulations deliver luciferase (LUC) mRNA to the liver, as demonstrated by the high bioluminescence signals. Shown are LNP1 (comprising SS-OP TM ), LNP2 (comprising cKK), and LNP3 (comprising DLin-MC3-DMA). An empty LNP formulation is also shown as a negative control (ctrl). Luciferase mRNA was formulated with the aforementioned LNPs 1, 2, and 3 and delivered intravenously into C57Bl6/J mice. 20 hours later, these mice were shaved and imaged after luciferin injection using an IVIS TM Bioluminescence imaging system. [0475] FIG. 20 shows in vivo delivery of mRNA in a photograph depicting the results demonstrating that luciferase mRNA LNPs causing high bioluminescence signal in liver. Luciferase mRNA was formulated with SS-OP using the lipid ratios for LNP1, as shown in Table 5. The lipid: mRNA ratios (wt/wt) were varied. The formulated mRNA LNPs were delivered via IV injection into C57Bl6/J mice at 0.6mg of total mRNA/kg of body weight. As a negative control, a mouse was injected with saline. 24 hours later, these mice were shaved and imaged after injection with luciferin using a Lago instrument from Spectral Instruments Imaging. Depicted is an BLI image from mice dosed with a lipid : mRNA ratio of 175, 42, and 25. The signal was highest in the mice receiving LNPs with a lipid : mRNA ratio (wt/wt) of 175 and 42. The other data presented here using LNP1 uses a wt/wt ratio of 42. [0476] FIG. 21 shows in vivo delivery of mRNA in a photograph depicting the results demonstrating that luciferase mRNA LNPs causing high bioluminescence signal in liver. LNPs designated as Lipid Nanoparticle 4 (LNP4) or Lipid Nanoparticle 5 (LNP5) were formulated using the recipe in Table 5 with luciferase mRNA. These LNPs were delivered via IV injection into C57Bl6/J mice at 0.6mg/kg. As a negative control, a mouse was injected with saline. 20 hours later, these mice were shaved and imaged after injection with luciferin using the Lago instrument from Spectral Instruments Imaging. LNP4 consisted of the formula for LNP2, but with SS-OP substituted for cKK-E12. LNP5 consisted of the formula for LNP1, but with cKK- E12 substituted for SS-OP. Bioluminescent imaging indicates that both of these LNPs had successful delivery to the liver. [0477] FIG. 22 shows in vivo delivery of mRNA in a photograph depicting the results demonstrating that luciferase mRNA LNPs causing high bioluminescence signal in liver. Luciferase mRNA was formulated with lipids per the recipe for LNP1 in Table 5. The ingredient that was varied was the molar ratio of DMG-PEG2000. As shown in FIG.22, DMG- PEG2000 was added as either 1, 1.5, 2, or 3 parts relative to the molar sum of all lipids, while the molar ratio for the other 3 lipids is held constant. This corresponds to a molar percentage for DMG-PEG2000 of approximately 1.0%, 1.5%, 2.0%, and 2.9%.20 hours after intravenous delivery at 0.6mg/kg, the C57Bl6/J mice were shaved and imaged following luciferin injection (75mg/kg) using the Lago instrument from Spectral Instruments Imaging. The signal was strong from all of the mice receiving active Luciferase mRNA LNPs, and the best signal was seen when DMG-PEG2000 was added in a molar ratio of 1.5 : 101.5 of total (~1.5%). The other data presented here use LNP1 with this molar ratio of DMG-PEG2000. [0478] FIG.23 is a capillary electrophoresis gel image showing that TERT mRNA LNPs cause high telomerase activity in liver. Tert mRNA (mTert SEQ 37) was formulated with LNP3, a lipid nanoparticle containing DLin-MC3-DMA (Table 5) and delivered i.v into TERT KO mice at 0.6mg/kg.16 hours or 8 days later (as indicated in the image), the livers were harvested for telomerase repeat amplification protocol (TRAP). The negative control was a TRAP performed on a liver from a TERT KO mouse that was injected with saline. Livers from mice treated with TERT mRNA LNP3 exhibit elevated telomerase activity which returns to baseline levels, indicating the increase in telomerase activity was transient. Example 2: Treatment of Fibrosis in a TAA Mouse Model with TERT mRNA [0479] This Example demonstrates that an LNP formulation with SS-OP (LNP1 in Table 5), administered intravenously, effectively delivered an mRNA encoding TERT to the liver in an amount effective to treat liver fibrosis. Treatment was demonstrated by reduced liver scaring in both female and male animals (FIG.9A, graph on left and FIG.9B). [0480] FIG.8 is a graph and a series of photographs of a first study demonstrating that TERT LNPs reduce fibrosis in Thioacetamide (TAA) drinking water model. The addition of thioacetamide (TAA) to drinking water represents an art-recognized model for the induction of experimental liver fibrosis in rodents (Wallace et al. Standard operating procedures in experimental liver research: thioacetamide model in mice and rats. Lab Anim.49:21-9 (2015)). In this experiment, TERT KO mice received 0.3 g/L TAA in their drinking water for 9.5 weeks. Mice were treated once weekly with LNP1 carrying 0.6 mg/kg of TERT mRNA (SEQ ID NO: 37) or Luciferase (LUC) mRNA. Liver sections were stained with Picrosirius red (PSR), and a quantification of showed a 24% mean reduction in PSR stained tissue in mice treated with TERT LNPs compared to those treated with LUC LNPs. Scale bar on photographs equals 500 µm. [0481] FIGS. 9A and 9B are graphs and photographs of a second study demonstrating that TERT LNPs Reduce Fibrosis in Thioacetamide (TAA) Drinking Water Model. TERT KO mice received 0.3 g/L TAA in their drinking water for 9.4 weeks and were treated with TERT or LUC LNPs once weekly. By picrosirius red (PSR) staining, there was an 18% mean reduction in fibrosis in female mice and a 37% mean reduction was observed in males treated with TERT LNPs, representing a significant (p=0.041) reduction in fibrosis. Scale bar on photographs equals 500 µm. Additionally, using the 0 through 4 scoring system developed by the Pathology Committee of the NASH Clinical Research Network (Kleiner et al. Hepatology 2005), animals treated with TERT mRNA LNPs had a significant reduction in fibrosis compared to control animals treated with LUC (luciferase) mRNA LNPs (p=0.032) as seen in FIG 9B. For all scoring, liver fibrosis was scored independently for each of 3 lobes per mouse (right, median, and left) in a blinded manner. The scores were averaged together to get a score per mouse, which is then plotted in the graph (FIG 8, FIG 9A, and FIG 9B). Example 3: Improved Survival in TAA Mouse Model after Treatment with TERT mRNA [0482] This Example demonstrates that an LNP formulation with SS-OP (LNP1 in Table 5), administered intravenously, effectively delivered an mRNA encoding TERT to the liver in an amount effective to treat liver fibrosis. Treatment was demonstrated by increased survival in the treatment group (TERT) compared to the control group (LUC) in FIG.10. TERT mRNA treated mice showed a 42% increase in median survival and a 58% increase in maximal survival. Moreover, the maximal lifespan for the TERT mRNA treated mice on the TAA liver toxin was 12.5% longer (117 vs 104 days) than the control mice that did not receive TAA. [0483] FIGS. 10A and 10B are graphs demonstrating that TERT mRNA improves survival. Survival plotted as fraction of mice alive as a function of days post first dose of either TERT (SEQ ID NO: 37) or a Luciferase (LUC) negative control. Same experimental procedure was followed as described in FIG.9, but mice were 4 th generation (G4) TERT KOs aged to over 30 weeks at the start of the study. These mice were dosed once weekly for 8 weeks with 0.6 mg/kg TERT or LUC mRNA, and survival was recorded after the first dose. Example 4: Decreased Inflammation and Increase Telomere Length after TERT mRNA Treatment [0484] This Example demonstrates that TERT mRNA treatment decreased inflammation and increased telomere length in the livers of treatment subject animals with liver fibrosis. Furthermore, it confirms that mRNA was delivered and translated at all dose levels tested (0.05 mg/kg to 0.6 mg/kg) in nearly all hepatocytes with an SS-OP-based LNP (LNP1). Lastly, it shows that both an SS-OP-based LNP and an MC3-based LNP are tolerated, with the SS-OP- based LNP having less toxicity (lower AST) than the MC3-based LNP. Further, the number of mice with pathological inflammation was significantly reduced in mice treated with TERT mRNA. Transfection efficiency with reporter mRNA in healthy and fibrotic subject animals [0485] The high in vivo transfection efficiency of reporter mRNA in the liver with LNP1 is shown in FIG. 12A. Different doses of Cre mRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles with ionizable LNP1 delivered intravenously to tdTomato fl/fl mice were quantified. tdTomato flox/flox (fl/fl) mice refers to knock-in of the tdTomato gene in which portions of the gene are flanked by two Cre recombinase recognition sites. FIG. 12B shows representative images of immunohistochemistry (IHC) using an anti-tdTomato antibody in liver sections from the knock-in mice. Hepatocyte cells were identified from mouse liver tissue sections using nuclear size and circularity with QuPath software. [0486] Low levels of liver damage markers were observed with successful TERT mRNA delivery. TERT mRNA was formulated with LNP1 or D-Lin-MC3-DMA (MC3) (LNP3) and delivered intravenously into C57Bl6 mice at 0.6 mg/kg. 24 hours later, the liver toxicity markers alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were measured. LNP1 delivery of TERT mRNA had equivalent or lower levels of ALT and AST compared to MC3 delivery of TERT mRNA (FIG.13). [0487] In vivo transfection efficiency of reporter mRNA was also high in fibrotic liver. Hepatocytes were identified using nuclear size and circularity by QuPath software, as described above. FIG. 14 B shows representative IHC images using an anti-tdTomato antibody in liver sections. Telomere extension and reduction in inflammation in liver of subject animals treated with fibrosis-inducing liver toxin [0488] FIG.11 are two graphs demonstrating that TERT LNPs reduce lobular inflammation in the livers of mice on the thioacetamide (TAA) drinking water model. The addition of thioacetamide (TAA) to drinking water represents an art-recognized model for the induction of experimental liver fibrosis in rodents. In this experiment, TERT KO mice received 0.3 g/L TAA in their drinking water for 9.5 weeks. Mice were treated once weekly with LNP1 carrying 0.6 mg/kg of TERT mRNA (SEQ ID NO: 37) or Luciferase (LUC) mRNA. TERT mRNA (SEQ ID NO: 37) in vivo delivery with the LNP1 formulation resulted in a 60% reduction in the number of animals with a score of > 1 (FIG.11B). Lobular inflammation was performed by a certified pathologist based on the non-alcoholic fatty liver disease NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) (Kleiner et al Design and validation of a histological scoring system for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Hepatology Jun 41(6);1313-21; 2005). The measurement was performed on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained liver sections from the thioacetamide (TAA) water experiment described in Example 2. Saline-treated animals had a mild inflammation score of 1 (< 2 foci per 200x field of view). [0489] Three doses of either TERT mRNA (SEQ ID NO: 37) or LUC mRNA formulated with LNP1 were delivered to TERT knock out (KO) mice once weekly intravenously at 0.5 mg/kg. The mRNA-LNP1 dosing was preceded two days prior by a dose of thioacetamide (TAA) intraperitoneally (i.p.) at 50mg/kg. Mice were harvested 1 week after the final dose of mRNA LNP1. Telomere length was quantified in hepatocytes using Q-FISH. Liver tissues were fixed, sectioned, and stained with a TelC fluorescent probe that labels the telomeres. Individual telomere fluorescence was quantified on a per cell basis (the median is shown in FIG.15A and the 10th percentile is shown in FIG. 15B), and the average was taken for each mouse. Each point represents a single mouse. Hepatocytes in mice treated with TERT mRNA had significantly longer telomeres than luciferase mRNA treated control animals. At least 300 cells were analyzed per mouse per treatment group. Telomere extension in human hepatocytes [0490] To measure telomerase activity in ex vivo human samples, the telomerase repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) assay was used on lysates from human hepatocytes incubated with an artificial telomere (DNA oligonucleotide). As described above in Example 1, when active telomerase is present, it extends the artificial telomere 6 base pairs bp at a time, producing a ladder pattern. This extension reaction is amplified by PCR and run on a gel (in this case Agilent bioanalyzer, a microfluidic agarose gel). The presence of a ladder in 6 bp increments indicates telomerase activity. [0491] Human hepatocytes from a 51-year-old donor were cultured and transfected with GFP mRNA or TERT mRNA (SEQ ID NO: 39) using Messenger Max TM from Thermo Scientific at 1 µg/ml. Cells were harvested at each time point indicated in FIG.16A for the TRAP assay to measure telomerase activity. An Agilent Bioanalyzer was used to detect the characteristic telomerase activity a ladder pattern as shown in FIG. 16A. Telomerase activity was detected strongly on day 1 and day 2 post-transfection, and weakly on day 7 post-transfection. It was not detected on day 14 post-transfection or in hepatocytes treated with GFP mRNA. [0492] Telomere length was quantified using a fluorescent probe to label the telomeres. Individual telomere fluorescence was quantified on a per cell level as the mean for FIG.17A and the 10 th percentile for FIG.17B. At least 150 cells were analyzed per treatment group. It was observed that telomerase activity returned to baseline by day 14. [0493] FIG.19 shows results of the telomerase activity assay “telomerase repeat amplification protocol” (TRAP) in human fibroblasts treated for 24 hours with 1 µg/ml TERT mRNAs of from left to right, untreated cells, SEQ ID NOS: 39, 40, 1, 2, 31, 3, 5, and 4 respectively, and a GFP mRNA control. Telomerase activity is indicated by a characteristic ladder pattern as shown by the transfection of TERT mRNAs of SEQ ID NOS: 39, 40, 1, 2, 31, 3, 5, and 4 to varying degrees. Untreated and GFP mRNA samples did not exhibit telomerase activity. Imaging of LNP1-TERT mRNA formulation [0494] The LNP1-TERT mRNA (SEQ ID NO: 40) formulation was imaged at high resolution using the Thermo Scientific Talos Glacios Cryo transmission electron microscope (TEM) at 34,000x magnification and 200kv voltage. A representative image is show in FIG. 18A; the TEM copper grid is the dark region on the right. The particle size was characterized using dynamic light scattering (DLS) using a Brookhaven 90Plus Particle Analyzer (FIG.18B). [0495] LNP1 nanoparticles comprising TERT mRNA were observed to have the following exemplary characteristics, shown in Table 6.
